Generate a safe, idempotent JavaScript snippet (with Liquid wrapper) that conditionally hides specified UI elements on a Shopify storefront when a creator funnel is active AND additional custom business logic is met.

**Base Condition (ALWAYS REQUIRED):**
- Creator funnel is active: `cc_creator` exists AND `cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount > 0`

**Additional Business Logic Condition:**
[ADD YOUR EXTRA CONDITIONS - Examples below]
- AND cart total exceeds $100
- AND specific product variants are in cart  
- AND during certain date ranges or promotional periods
- AND user has specific customer tags
- AND coming from specific traffic sources
- AND certain metafield values are present
- AND user is on mobile vs desktop
- [Or leave blank if only cc_creator condition needed]

**Target Elements:**
Popup/UI selectors to hide (provide class names or CSS selectors from Chrome DevTools):
```
const POPUP_SELECTORS = [
  '[INSERT YOUR SELECTORS HERE]'
];
```
Examples: `.klaviyo-form`, `.justuno-pop`, `#privy-container`, `.newsletter-modal`, `.chat-widget`, `.promotional-banner`

**Liquid Context Variables Needed:**
Base variables (always included):
- `cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']`
- `metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]`

Additional variables for your logic:
- `cart.total_price`
- `customer.tags`
- `product.metafields`
- `collection.handle`
- `template.name`

**Console Message:**
What message should appear in console when blocking is active?
Example: `"Blocking popups to prioritize creator funnel over first-timer offer"`

**Liquid Condition Structure:**
```liquid
{% assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle'] %}
{% assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle] %}
{% if cc_creator and cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount > 0 and [YOUR_ADDITIONAL_CONDITIONS] %}
```

**Requirements:**
- Add to theme.liquid near `</body>`
- Always check cc_creator base condition first
- Hide elements using `cc-hidden` class + `display:none !important` + `aria-hidden="true"`
- Handle both initial DOM and dynamically injected elements (MutationObserver)
- Be idempotent and fail gracefully
- No external dependencies
- Don't break checkout functionality

**Output Format:**
Return one complete Liquid + JS snippet ready to paste into theme.liquid, maintaining the cc_creator base logic.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**

```
Additional Business Logic: AND cart total is over $75
Target Elements: .klaviyo-form, #upsell-popup
Console Message: "Blocking popups for high-value creator funnel customers"

Result: Only blocks popups when creator funnel is active AND cart is over $75
```
