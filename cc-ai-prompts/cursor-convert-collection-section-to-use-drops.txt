Convert any existing Shopify section that renders products from a collection to also support CreatorCommerce drops.

**Template:**
```
Convert an existing Shopify section that renders products from a collection to also support CreatorCommerce drops, while preserving all original functionality as a fallback.

**Target Section:**
`[INSERT SECTION FILE NAME HERE]` (e.g., `sections/featured-products.liquid`)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Follow `cc-converting-existing-files` rules exactly for dual-mode architecture
- Use `cc-referencing-drops-data` rules for drops iteration and product matching
- Apply `cc-referencing-co-branded-data` rules for creator resolution and data access
- Preserve all existing features, schema settings, and styling unchanged
- Maintain backward compatibility - section must work exactly as before when no creator drops are present

**Data Flow Logic:**
```
1. Check for creator drops → cc_creator.data.value['cc-creator-drops']
2. If drops exist → Render drops feed (title + description + products per drop)
3. If no drops → Fallback to original collection behavior from section settings
```

**Schema Updates:**
- Update section name to include "CC" prefix (e.g., "CC Featured Products Drops")
- Add explanatory paragraph about drops vs collection fallback behavior
- Label collection setting as "Fallback Collection" with helpful info text
- Keep all existing settings for backward compatibility

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Works with creator drops present (shows drops feed)
- [ ] Works with no creator drops (shows original collection)
- [ ] Works with empty/malformed drop data (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Preserves all original section functionality
- [ ] Maintains responsive behavior and styling
- [ ] Type conversion works without Liquid parsing errors

**Expected Output:**
- One updated `.liquid` file that works in both modes
- All original functionality preserved
- Drops support added following established patterns
- Schema updated appropriately
