Render dynamic UI elements based on creator metaobject data.

**Template:**
```
We need to dynamically render [UI-UX-OUTCOME] for a creator using the creator metaobject from the CreatorCommerce app.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Follow `cc-referencing-co-branded-data` rules for creator resolution and data access patterns
- Use template context branching for metaobject vs regular pages
- Escape all unsafe strings with `| escape` filter
- Add null guards at every level of data access
- Provide neutral fallbacks when creator data is missing

**Fields to reference:**
[
In Shopify: Content > Metaobjects > Creator > Select an entry > Copy/paste relevant JSON fields for the prompt here

OR

Ask sidekick "Get the JSON data from the creator metaobject for CREATOR-SHOP-HANDLE, but only return the following fields:
INSERT-FIELD-NAMES-FOR-THE-PROMPT-HERE"
]

**UI Requirements:**

1. [UI-UX-REQUIREMENT-1]
   If [FIELD-NAME] is [VALUE], show [UI-UX-EXPECTATION].

2. [UI-UX-REQUIREMENT-2]
   If [FIELD-NAME] is [VALUE], show [UI-UX-EXPECTATION].

**Logic & Empty States:**
- If a field value is missing or evaluates to false/empty, do not render the related UI block
- If key field values are missing/false/empty and no fallbacks are provided, hide the entire section
