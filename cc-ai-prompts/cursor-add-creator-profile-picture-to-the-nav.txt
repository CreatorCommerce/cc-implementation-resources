Add creator's profile picture to the navigation bar positioned relative to the brand logo.

**Template:**
```
Add creator's profile picture to the navigation bar positioned relative to the brand logo.

**Target File:**
`snippets/header.liquid` or `sections/header.liquid` (whichever contains the main navigation)

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Follow `cc-referencing-co-branded-data` rules for creator resolution
- Use template context branching for metaobject vs regular pages
- Apply proper null guards and fallback handling
- Include affiliate link functionality when available

**Creator Fields to Use:**
```json
{
  "cc-creator-profile-picture": {
    "url": "https://example.com/profile.jpg",
    "alt": "Creator profile picture"
  },
  "cc-collab-affiliate-link": "https://example.com/creator-shop"
}
```

**Layout Requirements:**
- Position to the left of the brand logo
- Circular styling with configurable dimensions
- Match logo height for visual balance
- Include hover effects and responsive design
- Support affiliate link functionality when available

**Expected Output:**
- Creator profile picture appears to the left of the brand logo when available
- Perfect circular styling and height matching
- When affiliate link exists, profile picture becomes clickable and opens creator's shop in new tab
- Falls back gracefully when no creator or profile picture exists
