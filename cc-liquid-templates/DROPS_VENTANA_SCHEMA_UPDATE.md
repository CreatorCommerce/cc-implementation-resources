# Drops Product Grid Ventana - Schema Update Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Reorganized Schema Settings

The `drops-product-grid-ventana.liquid` section has been updated to match the organizational structure of `hero-primavera-mini-single-optimized.liquid`.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Unnecessary User Inputs**

The following settings have been removed and replaced with hardcoded defaults:
- ‚ùå **Show second image on hover** (now: `false`)
- ‚ùå **Show vendor** (now: `false`)
- ‚ùå **Show product rating** (now: `false`)
- ‚ùå **Image ratio** (now: `'square'`)
- ‚ùå **Image shape** (now: `'default'`)

These values are now hardcoded in the `product-card` render on line 597-605:

```liquid
{% render 'product-card',
  card_product: card_product,
  media_aspect_ratio: 'square',
  image_shape: 'default',
  show_secondary_image: false,
  show_vendor: false,
  show_rating: false,
  section_id: section.id
%}
```

### 2. **Added Descriptive Headers**

Following the Primavera hero pattern, added three informational headers:

#### **The Creator Drops Section**
> "The Creator Drops Section displays curated product bundles from your creators in an elegant, switchable grid. Each creator can have multiple 'drops' (collections of products), and customers can seamlessly toggle between them using a dropdown selector. This section is perfect for showcasing expert recommendations, themed bundles, or seasonal collections‚Äîall with one-click 'Add Bundle to Cart' functionality that makes purchasing effortless."

#### **Before Building**
> "Make sure a page template exists for the Creator metaobject. Add this section to the Creator metaobject page template. Ensure your creator has drops configured with products assigned. The section will automatically pull in all drops and their associated products from the metaobject data."

#### **For Testing**
> "To test, preview the theme with the section (saves the preview cookie). Then click the creator's affiliate link‚Äîbut first ensure that creator is in a live campaign redirecting to the page with this section. You should then see the co-branded context with their drops displayed. Switch between drops using the dropdown to test the product grid switching functionality."

### 3. **Reorganized Settings into Categories**

Settings are now organized into three clear categories:

#### **üìù Content & Text**
- Tagline
- Heading
- Heading size
- Add line break after heading
- Show creator name
- Creator name prefix
- Button text

#### **üé® Design & Styling**
- Color scheme
- Number of columns on desktop
- Number of columns on tablet
- Top padding
- Bottom padding

#### **‚ú® Custom CSS**
- Custom CSS textarea (NEW!)

### 4. **Added Custom CSS Support**

Added a new `custom_css` textarea setting that allows users to override any styles in the section. The CSS is injected at the end of the style block (lines 352-355):

```liquid
/* Custom CSS */
{%- if section.settings.custom_css != blank -%}
  {{ section.settings.custom_css }}
{%- endif -%}
```

**Example Usage:**
```css
#shopify-section-{{ section.id }} .cc-main-title { 
  color: #ff0000; 
  font-size: 48px;
}
```

### 5. **Enhanced Info Text**

All settings now include helpful `info` text to guide users:

- **Tagline**: "Small uppercase text displayed above the main heading"
- **Heading**: "Main heading text (will be followed by creator name if enabled below)"
- **Title line break**: "Puts the creator name on a new line"
- **Show creator name**: "Display the creator's first and last name after the heading"
- **Creator prefix**: "Text shown before the creator's name (e.g., 'Bundles by Sarah Johnson')"
- **Button text**: "Text displayed on the add to cart button"
- **Columns tablet**: "Mobile is always a horizontal scrolling carousel"
- **Custom CSS**: "Enter valid CSS code to customize this section's appearance..."
