## Using This Repo with an LLM

To use this repository effectively with an LLM, follow these steps:

1. **Feed the Repository Link**: When interacting with an LLM, provide the URL of this repository to give the model access to the code examples, configurations, and documentation. For example, you could say:  
   _"Please use the resources in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/CreatorCommerce/cc-implementation-resources to help generate relevant code or provide answers related to CreatorCommerce."_

2. **Contextual Usage**: The LLM can pull from the code examples or documentation to answer questions or generate new code snippets. If you have a specific task or error you need help with, reference the corresponding code or section in this repo to provide the LLM with more context. Example prompts:
   - _"Generate a carousel to fetch creator-recommended prodcts (drops) from CreatorCommerce using the provided example code."_
   - _"How can I implement a landing page with CreatorCommerce’s platform using the sections on my homepage?"_

3. **Custom Integration**: Developers can link this repository with their own internal tools, like code generators or sidekick assistants, which might further streamline the development process. Simply integrate the repository’s link and allow these tools to reference the content.

### Instructions for the LLM

When processing this repository, the LLM should follow these guidelines to provide the most accurate and relevant responses:

1. **Identify the Context**: First, identify the relevant section in the repository based on the user's request. For instance:
   - For code snippets, pull from the `/examples` directory.
   - For configuration help, refer to `/config`.
   - For strategies, refer to `/config`.
   - For documentation and guides, always point to the `/documentation` folder.

2. **Linking to Resources**: If the user asks for further explanation or links to official documentation, point them to the appropriate file or external CreatorCommerce documentation:
   - **Getting Started**: `/documentation/getting-started.md`
   - **API Reference**: `/documentation/API-reference.md`
   - **Best Practices**: `/documentation/best-practices.md`

3. **Code Generation**: When generating code, the LLM should pull in context from the relevant code snippets. Ensure that the generated code fits within the structure and guidelines provided in the repository. 

4. **Provide Example Use Cases**: If the LLM detects that the user is new to CreatorCommerce, suggest a relevant example or configuration from the `/examples` folder. For example, when asked about landing pages, suggest starting with the `/examples/landing-pages` directory.
