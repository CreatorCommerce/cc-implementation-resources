# Contributing to CreatorCommerce Code Snippets & Resources

We’re excited that you want to contribute to the **CreatorCommerce Code Snippets & Resources** repository! This repository aims to make integrating CreatorCommerce easier for developers by providing clear examples, configuration files, and documentation. By contributing, you’ll be helping make these resources even better!

## How to Contribute

We follow a straightforward GitHub workflow for contributions. To ensure the process is smooth and consistent, please follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository. This creates a personal copy where you can freely make changes.

- Navigate to [CreatorCommerce Code Snippets & Resources](https://github.com/CreatorCommerce/Resources).
- Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the repository.
- This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine to start making changes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Resources.git
cd Resources
```

### 3. Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch. Make sure the branch name is descriptive of the changes you are making.

```bash
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```

For example, if you're adding a new example for integrating CreatorCommerce with a third-party service, name your branch something like `add-api-integration-example`.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Now, you can start making changes. Be sure to:

* **Follow the repository structure**: Place new examples in the `/examples` directory, configuration files in the `/config` directory, and documentation updates in the `/documentation` directory.
* **Write clear, well-documented code**: Code snippets should be clean, well-commented, and easy to follow.
* **Update the `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` if necessary**: If your changes require updates to the main documentation, feel free to add those to the relevant files.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you’re done, commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message that explains the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add API integration example for CreatorCommerce"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

After committing your changes, push them to your fork.

```bash
git push origin your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

Once your changes are pushed, open a **pull request** (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository.

* Go to the **Pull Requests** tab on the original repository.
* Click the **New Pull Request** button.
* Make sure to provide a detailed description of the changes in your PR, including the problem your change solves and any relevant context (e.g., links to issues, explanations, etc.).
* Select the `main` branch of the original repository as the base and your newly pushed branch as the compare branch.

### 8. Code Review and Feedback

Once your PR is submitted, the maintainers will review your changes. If they have feedback or request any modifications, you can make the necessary updates and push them to your branch. Your PR will automatically update.

### 9. Merge

Once the changes are approved, a maintainer will merge your PR into the main repository. Your changes will now be part of the project!
