Understanding which creators drive results is essential for optimizing your partnerships. This guide covers attribution tracking and performance analysis.

## How Attribution Works

### Cart Attributes

**Automatic Tracking:**
When customers click creator links or visit creator storefronts, CreatorCommerce sets cart attributes:
- `cc-creator-id` - Creator's unique ID
- `cc-creator-handle` - Creator's handle (for metaobject lookup)
- `cc-campaign-id` - Campaign ID (if applicable)

**These attributes persist:**
- Through checkout process
- In order metadata
- For attribution tracking
- Across session

### Order Attribution

**Attributed Orders Include:**
- Creator ID in order metadata
- Creator handle in order attributes
- Campaign ID (if applicable)
- Discount code used (creator-specific)

**What Gets Tracked:**
