## What is the CC SDK?

The CreatorCommerce SDK is a lightweight JavaScript layer that detects affiliate context from incoming links and stores it in Shopify cart attributes. It runs automatically in the background — once enabled, it handles:

- **Shopper context detection** — When a user arrives through an affiliate link, the SDK reads the creator, campaign, and shop identifiers from the URL
- **Cart attribute persistence** — The SDK writes `cc-creator-handle`, `cc-creator-id`, `cc-campaign-id`, and `cc-shop-id` to the Shopify cart
- **Automatic updates** — If the shopper clicks a different affiliate link, the SDK seamlessly updates the cart attributes to reflect the new context
- **Personalization triggers** — Once cart attributes are set, your Liquid templates can resolve the full creator metaobject and personalize the experience

## Installation

The SDK is delivered as a Shopify **Theme App Embed**. To enable it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Theme App Embeds">
    In Shopify Admin → **Online Store → Themes → Customize → App Embeds**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable CreatorCommerce SDK">
    Toggle the CreatorCommerce SDK embed to **ON** and save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

No code changes are required. The SDK inject runs on every page of your theme once enabled.

## Cart Attributes Set by the SDK

When a shopper arrives through an affiliate link, the SDK writes these attributes:

| Attribute | Example Value | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `cc-creator-handle` | `"tiffanyhoughton"` | Primary key for resolving the creator metaobject |
| `cc-creator-id` | `"677c1a5b7ea8a6e015ab46f3"` | CreatorCommerce internal creator ID |
| `cc-campaign-id` | `"6765aa58f5ea34a02280fd3e"` | Campaign the creator belongs to |
| `cc-shop-id` | `"677c1a5b7ea8a6e015ab46f3"` | CreatorCommerce shop identifier |

## Basic Liquid Usage

Once the SDK sets cart attributes, resolve the creator in any section or snippet:

```liquid
{% liquid
  if metaobject
    assign cc_creator = metaobject
  else
    assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']
    assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]
  endif
  
  assign has_creator = cc_creator != blank
%}

{% if has_creator %}
  <h1>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Picks</h1>
{% endif %}
```

<Tip>
Place this block at the top of any section or snippet that needs creator context. It's safe to call everywhere — if no creator is present, `cc_creator` will be blank and conditional blocks won't render.
</Tip>

## Verifying the SDK

To confirm the SDK is working, open your browser console on any page after clicking an affiliate link and run:

```javascript
fetch(window.Shopify.routes.root + 'cart.js')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(cart => {
    console.log('Cart attributes:', cart.attributes);
    if (cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']) {
      console.log('✅ SDK is active. Creator:', cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']);
    } else {
      console.log('❌ No CC attributes found. Check that the SDK embed is enabled.');
    }
  });
```

You should see the `cc-` attributes in the response if the SDK is active.

## How Attribute Updates Work

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Shopper clicks Creator A's link | Attributes set to Creator A |
| Same shopper clicks Creator B's link | Attributes **overwritten** to Creator B |
| Shopper visits directly (no affiliate link) | Existing attributes **persist** from last affiliate visit |
| Cart is emptied / new session | Attributes cleared with the cart |
