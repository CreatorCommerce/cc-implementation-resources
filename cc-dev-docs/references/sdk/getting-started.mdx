## What is the CC SDK?

The CreatorCommerce SDK is a collection of Liquid snippets that handle creator data resolution, fallback logic, and common co-branding patterns. It eliminates boilerplate and ensures consistency across your theme.

## Installation

The SDK is automatically available when you install CreatorCommerce. Core snippets are injected into your theme's `snippets/` directory.

## Core Snippets

| Snippet | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `cc-resolve-creator` | Resolves creator from metaobject or cart attributes |
| `cc-calculate-contrast` | Calculates text color based on background |
| `cc-dynamic-text` | Token replacement for personalized copy |
| `cc-product-price` | Displays discounted pricing |

## Basic Usage

```liquid
{% comment %} At the top of any section {% endcomment %}
{% render 'cc-resolve-creator' %}

{% comment %} Now cc_creator is available {% endcomment %}
{% if cc_creator %}
  <h1>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Picks</h1>
{% endif %}
```
