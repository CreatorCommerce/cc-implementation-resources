The CreatorCommerce Unified API provides programmatic access to manage creators, collaborations, drops, and checkout URLs. Use this API to build custom dashboards, integrate with external tools, or create bespoke creator experiences.

## Base URL

```
https://unified-api.creatorcommerce.shop
```

## Authentication

Two authentication methods are supported:

| Method | Header | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Bearer Token (JWT)** | `Authorization: Bearer {token}` | Authenticated user requests |
| **Channel API Key** | `x-channel-access-token: {key}` | Server-to-server brand requests |
| **Partner API Key** | `x-partner-access-token: {key}` | Creator-facing requests |

See the [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication) for setup details.

## API Patterns

The API is organized into two patterns:

### Channel-Centric (Brand Side)

Endpoints prefixed with `/channels/{myshopifyDomain}/` are used by brands to manage their program:

- **Collabs** -- List, get, and update collaborations
- **Tiers** -- Retrieve configured collab tiers
- **Drops** -- Update product curation and enhancements
- **Magic Links** -- Generate authenticated creator links

### Creator-Centric (Creator Side)

Endpoints prefixed with `/creators/` are used by creators to manage their own data:

- **Collabs** -- View and update their collaborations
- **Drops** -- Create and manage product curation
- **Cart URLs** -- Generate checkout-ready URLs
