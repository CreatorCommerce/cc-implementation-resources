## Available Actions

CreatorCommerce exposes actions in Shopify Flow that let you automate partner program operations without writing code.

| Action | What It Does | Common Use |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Update Partner Tier** | Changes a partner's collaboration tier | Auto-promote based on performance |
| **Tag Partner** | Adds a tag to a partner's collab record | Segment for campaigns |
| **Send CC Notification** | Triggers a notification through CC | Custom alerts |
| **Sync Partner Data** | Forces a data refresh for a partner | After external changes |

## Using Actions in Flow

### Auto-Promote Top Performers

```
Trigger: CC Order Attributed
Condition: Partner total sales >= 50 orders
Action: Update Partner Tier → "Gold"
Action: Send CC Notification → "Congratulations on Gold tier!"
```

### Flag High-Value Partners

```
Trigger: CC Order Attributed
Condition: Order value >= $500
Action: Tag Partner → "high-value-driver"
Action: Send Slack message → #partner-wins
```

### Campaign Enrollment

```
Trigger: CC Partner Activated
Condition: Partner tier == "Ambassador"
Action: Tag Partner → "holiday-campaign-2025"
```

## Combining Triggers and Actions

The real power is combining CC triggers with CC actions and other Shopify Flow connectors:

| Trigger | + Condition | + Action |
|---------|------------|----------|
| CC Order Attributed | Revenue threshold met | Update Partner Tier |
| CC Partner Created | Tier == "Starter" | Send onboarding email via Klaviyo |
| CC Drop Created | Partner is in "VIP" segment | Post to Slack, send thank-you |
| CC Milestone Reached | Milestone == "100 orders" | Tag Partner, update tier |
