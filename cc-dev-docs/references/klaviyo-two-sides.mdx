## Side 2: Co-branded Customer Emails

### Key Data Available

When customers are attributed to partners, their Klaviyo profiles include:

- Partner bio/description
- Custom partner fields

## Connecting Both Sides

The magic happens when you connect both sides:

1. **Partner promotes** → Customer purchases → **Customer receives co-branded emails**
2. **Partner receives** performance update → Partner promotes more → **Cycle continues**

This creates a flywheel where both partner engagement and customer experience reinforce each other.
