title: 'The Two Sides of Klaviyo'
description: 'Using Klaviyo for both affiliate lifecycle messaging (B2B) and co-branded consumer emails (B2C) through CreatorCommerce.'
---

CreatorCommerce uses Klaviyo in two fundamentally different ways. Understanding the distinction is critical to building effective email programs.

## Side 1: Affiliate Messaging (B2B)

Communicate directly with your creators, influencers, and affiliates through automated Klaviyo flows.

### What It Is

Emails and SMS sent **to your creators** as part of their lifecycle with your brand. These messages onboard, activate, retain, and celebrate your partners.

### Events That Power It

| Klaviyo Event | Fires When | Flow It Triggers |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `Creator Collaboration Started` | CC syncs a new affiliate from your platform | Collab Invitation |
| `Creator Drop Created` | Creator adds products to their shop | Welcome Series, New Drop |
| `Creator Invitation Accepted` | Creator starts onboarding | Onboarding Abandonment (if no drop within 4h) |
| `Creator Order Attributed` | A sale is tracked to the creator | Sales Milestones |
| `Shop Updated` | Creator updates their shop settings | Shop Updated confirmation |
| `Creator Added To Campaign` | Campaign is launched or creator is added | New Campaign |

### The 8 Core Flows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Collab Invitation">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Collaboration Started`
    **Exit:** `Creator Drop Created` or flow completes
    **Purpose:** Inform the affiliate about the co-branded program and guide them to set up their shop
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Welcome Series">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Drop Created` (first time)
    **Exit:** `Creator Order Attributed` or flow completes
    **Purpose:** Welcome the affiliate and get them excited about co-selling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. New Drop">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Drop Created`
    **Exit:** Single email sent
    **Purpose:** Remind the affiliate to share their new product recommendation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Onboarding Abandonment">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Invitation Accepted` with no `Creator Drop Created` in 4 hours
    **Exit:** `Creator Drop Created` or flow completes
    **Purpose:** Re-engage affiliates who started setup but didn't finish
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Sales Milestones">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Order Attributed`
    **Exit:** Single email sent
    **Purpose:** Gamify the program -- celebrate first sale, 10th sale, and beyond
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="6. Shop Abandoned">
    **Trigger:** Added to "Abandoned Creator Shop" segment (no sale or drop in 60 days)
    **Exit:** `Creator Drop Created` or `Creator Order Attributed` or flow completes
    **Purpose:** Re-engage affiliates who set up their shop but went inactive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="7. Shop Updated">
    **Trigger:** `Shop Updated`
    **Exit:** Single email sent
    **Purpose:** Confirm changes and reaffirm their new handle if changed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="8. New Campaign">
    **Trigger:** `Creator Added To Campaign`
    **Exit:** `Creator Removed From Campaign` or `Creator Added To Campaign` (different campaign) or flow completes
    **Purpose:** Notify affiliates about campaigns they should participate in
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Getting Templates

CreatorCommerce provides production-ready email templates for all 8 flows. To get them:

1. Submit a request through the CC dashboard
2. Import the provided templates into Klaviyo
3. Customize branding (logo, colors, copy)
4. Review the `\{\{ variables \}\}` carefully before editing
5. Set flows to "Live" when ready

<Warning>
Before going live with flows, ensure your affiliate platform integration is connected to both CC and Klaviyo. Affiliates entering the Collab Invitation flow need a co-branded page already built so they have something to share.
</Warning>

## Side 2: Consumer Co-branding (B2C)

Personalize customer-facing emails with creator context so the trust that drove the initial click carries through every touchpoint.

### What It Is

Emails sent **to your customers** that reference the creator who referred them. These are your existing Klaviyo flows (cart abandonment, post-purchase, etc.) enhanced with creator personalization.

### How Creator Data Reaches Klaviyo (Current Recommended)

```
Customer clicks creator link
       |
CC SDK writes cart attributes (cc-creator-handle, cc-discount-code)
       |
Shopify Flow template validates creator context + fetches creator metaobject data
       |
Klaviyo Track an Event action logs B2C event + customer properties
       |
Flows branch: creator-attributed vs. standard
```

### B2C Event Templates and Names

| Shopify Flow Template | Klaviyo Event Name | Typical Use |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `CC // Log a customer abandoned cart Klaviyo event` | `Creator Checkout Abandoned` | Cart abandonment journey |
| `CC // Log a custom post-purchase Klaviyo event` | `Creator Attributed Order` | Post-purchase / reorder / review asks |
| `CC // Log a customer marketing opt-in Klaviyo event` | `Marketing Opt In From Creator` | Welcome + nurture flows after subscribe |

### Klaviyo Profile Properties

When a customer is attributed to a creator, these properties are set on their Klaviyo profile:

| Property | Example | Use In Templates |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `cc-creator-shop-handle` | `sarah-jones` | Link back to creator page |
| `cc-creator-first-name` | `Sarah` | Subject lines, body copy |
| `cc-collab-discount-code` | `SARAH15` | Discount reminder blocks |
| `cc-collab-discount-amount` | `15` | Savings callouts |
| `cc-creator-profile-picture` | URL | Header image personalization |

In Shopify Flow `Track an Event`, `Event Properties` are typically mapped from:

- `{{getMetaobjectEntry.data}}`

And `Customer Properties` include creator/collab keys such as:
- `cc-creator-first-name`
- `cc-creator-last-name`
- `cc-creator-profile-picture`
- `cc-creator-shop-title`
- `cc-creator-shop-theme-primary-color`
- `cc-creator-shop-handle`
- `cc-collab-affiliate-link`
- `cc-collab-discount-amount`
- `cc-collab-discount-code`
- `cc-collab-affiliate-code`
- `cc-collab-discount-type`
- `cc-creator-shop-description`

### Flows to Co-brand

| Flow | Personalization | Example Subject |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Cart abandonment** | Creator discount reminder | "Sarah saved 15% for you" |
| **Post-purchase** | Creator thank-you | "Thanks for shopping with Sarah!" |
| **Welcome** | Creator intro | "Sarah thought you would love us" |
| **Browse abandonment** | Creator product picks | "Still looking? Sarah recommends these" |
| **Win-back** | Creator re-engagement | "Sarah has new picks for you" |
| **Review request** | Creator endorsement | "How did you like Sarah's recommendations?" |

### Template Pattern

In Klaviyo templates, use conditional blocks to show creator content when available:

```
{% if person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' %}
  <!-- Co-branded version -->
  Shopping with {{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' }}
{% else %}
  <!-- Standard version -->
  Welcome back!
{% endif %}
```
