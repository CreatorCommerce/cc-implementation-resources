CreatorCommerce automatically tags orders and customers in Shopify when a sale is attributed to a creator. These tags enable native filtering, reporting, and workflow automation without leaving Shopify Admin.

## Order Tags

Every order attributed to a CreatorCommerce affiliate receives these tags:

| Tag | Format | Example | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| Creator ID | `cc-creator-id-{id}` | `cc-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb` | Identifies which creator drove the sale |
| Campaign ID | `cc-campaign-id-{id}` | `cc-campaign-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb` | Identifies which campaign the sale belongs to |
| General | `CreatorCommerce` | `CreatorCommerce` | Quick filter for all CC-attributed orders |

### Order Attributes (Backup)

The same data is also stored as **order attributes** (via cart attributes at checkout). This provides a secondary lookup method:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `cc-creator-id` | Creator's CreatorCommerce ID |
| `cc-campaign-id` | Campaign ID |
| `cc-creator-handle` | Creator's shop handle |
| `cc-shop-id` | Shop identifier |

## Customer Tags

Customers who purchase through a creator link receive:

| Tag | Format | Example | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| Creator identity | `cc-creator-id-{id}` | `cc-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb` | Marks the customer record as a creator (if they are one) |
| Referred by | `cc-referred-from-creator-id-{id}` | `cc-referred-from-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb` | Tracks which creator referred this customer |

<Note>
Customer tags **persist** even if the customer makes future purchases without using an affiliate link. This preserves lifetime attribution to the original creator.
</Note>

## Using Tags in Shopify Admin

### Filter Orders by Creator

1. Go to **Orders** in Shopify Admin
2. In the search bar, type: `tag:cc-creator-id-{creator-id}`
3. All orders from that creator appear

### Filter All CC Orders

Search for: `tag:CreatorCommerce`

### Filter Orders by Campaign

Search for: `tag:cc-campaign-id-{campaign-id}`

### Find Customers Referred by a Creator

1. Go to **Customers** in Shopify Admin
2. Search: `tag:cc-referred-from-creator-id-{creator-id}`
3. View all customers that creator has referred

## Reporting Use Cases

| Report | How to Build |
|--------|-------------|
| Revenue per creator | Filter orders by `cc-creator-id-{id}`, sum total sales |
| Revenue per campaign | Filter orders by `cc-campaign-id-{id}`, sum total sales |
| New customers per creator | Filter customers by `cc-referred-from-creator-id-{id}`, count records |
| Customer LTV per creator | Filter customers by referral tag, analyze total spend |
| Creator order volume | Filter orders by `CreatorCommerce` tag, count per period |

## Automation with Shopify Flow

These tags can trigger Shopify Flow workflows:

- **Order tagged with `CreatorCommerce`** → Send internal Slack notification
- **Customer tagged with `cc-referred-from-creator-id-*`** → Add to a Klaviyo segment
- **Order tagged with specific campaign** → Apply fulfillment priority

## Implementation Details

- **Automatic** — Tags are applied by CreatorCommerce when the order is processed. No manual setup required beyond having the SDK enabled.
- **Non-destructive** — CC tags are added alongside any existing tags. They don't overwrite other tags.
- **Editable** — You can manually edit or remove tags in Shopify Admin, but removing CC tags will break reporting for that order/customer.
- **Idempotent** — Repeat purchases through the same creator won't create duplicate tags.
