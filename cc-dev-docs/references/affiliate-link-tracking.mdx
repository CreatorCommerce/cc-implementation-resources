description: 'Technical reference for how CreatorCommerce preserves affiliate platform tracking while adding its own attribution layer.'
---

CreatorCommerce manages affiliate link redirects to preserve tracking integrity across all connected platforms. The result is bulletproof attribution that bundles CreatorCommerce's tracking alongside your affiliate partner's tracking — without modifying their parameters.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Affiliate Link Click">
    A shopper clicks an affiliate link generated by your affiliate platform (Social Snowball, Refersion, GRIN, etc.). CreatorCommerce intercepts this click via the redirect endpoint (`/apps/cc-storefront/redirect`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Parameter Preservation">
    CreatorCommerce reads all existing tracking parameters from the affiliate platform URL. **None are modified or removed.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="CC Parameter Appended">
    CreatorCommerce appends its own tracking parameter: `cc={tracking-handle}`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirect to Destination">
    The shopper is redirected to the final destination URL with all parameters intact.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### URL Example

**Original affiliate link:**
```
https://your-brand.com?affid=abc123&source=affiliate
```

**After CreatorCommerce redirect:**
```
https://your-brand.com?affid=abc123&source=affiliate&cc=creatorcommerce-handle
```

Both platforms receive full attribution:
- **Affiliate platform** sees `affid=abc123` and `source=affiliate` 
- **CreatorCommerce SDK** reads the `cc` parameter and sets cart attributes

## What Gets Tracked

| Layer | Mechanism | What It Captures |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Affiliate platform | Original URL parameters | Click, conversion, commission |
| CreatorCommerce SDK | `cc` URL parameter → cart attributes | Creator context, campaign, funnel events |
| CreatorCommerce Web Pixel | Checkout events | Revenue, AOV, conversion rate |
| Shopify tags | Order & customer tags | Creator attribution, campaign attribution |

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| SDK enabled | The CreatorCommerce Theme App Embed must be active on your Shopify theme |
| Active affiliate link | Your affiliate platform must generate valid links with tracking parameters |
| Redirect endpoint | Affiliate links must route through `/apps/cc-storefront/redirect` for CC tracking to work |
| URL parameter support | Your site must support parameterized URLs (standard for all Shopify stores) |

## Important Details

### CreatorCommerce Does Not Manage Third-Party Scripts

CreatorCommerce preserves and passes along affiliate tracking parameters, but it does **not** install, maintain, or interact with your affiliate partner's tracking scripts. Those scripts must be installed separately per your affiliate platform's instructions.

### Parameter Chaining

If the affiliate link already contains multiple parameters, CreatorCommerce chains its parameter with `&`:

```
https://brand.com?affid=abc&source=aff&campaign=summer  →
https://brand.com?affid=abc&source=aff&campaign=summer&cc=creator-handle
```

### No Parameter Conflicts

CreatorCommerce uses the `cc` parameter namespace, which doesn't conflict with any known affiliate platform parameters. If you observe unexpected URL behavior, check your affiliate platform's documentation for automatic parameter rewriting rules.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| CC attributes not set after click | SDK not enabled | Enable the Theme App Embed in Shopify |
| Affiliate platform not tracking | Script not installed | Install the affiliate platform's tracking script separately |
| Parameters missing after redirect | Affiliate platform rewriting URLs | Check platform settings for URL normalization rules |
| `cc` parameter not appearing | Link not routing through CC redirect | Ensure destination URL uses `/apps/cc-storefront/redirect` |

## Verification

After clicking a test affiliate link:

1. Check the browser URL bar — you should see both the affiliate parameters and `&cc=...`
2. Open browser console and run:
```javascript
fetch('/cart.js').then(r => r.json()).then(c => console.log(c.attributes));
```
3. Verify `cc-creator-handle` and other `cc-` attributes are present
4. Check your CreatorCommerce dashboard for the click event
5. Check your affiliate platform dashboard for its click event
