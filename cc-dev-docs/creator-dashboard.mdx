The Creator Dashboard is where creators manage their collaborations, drops, and profile settings. You can customize this experience in two ways:

## Option 1: Build a Custom Dashboard via API

Build a completely custom creator dashboard using the CreatorCommerce API and integrate it into Shopify's Customer Account Portal. This approach gives you:

- **Full design control**: Build the UI from scratch using your preferred framework
- **Complete customization**: Match your brand's exact design system
- **Flexible workflows**: Create custom onboarding flows and user journeys
- **Native integration**: Embed within Shopify's Customer Account Portal for a seamless experience

See the [API Reference](/unified-api-reference) for endpoints and authentication details.

## Option 2: Customize the Hosted Dashboard with CSS

Use CreatorCommerce's hosted dashboard and customize it with CSS to match your brand. This approach provides:

- **Quick implementation**: Start with a fully functional dashboard
- **CSS theming**: Re-skin the dashboard using stable selectors and classes
- **No code maintenance**: We handle updates and feature additions
- **Brand consistency**: Apply your colors, fonts, and styling throughout

The following documentation covers CSS customization for the hosted dashboard.
