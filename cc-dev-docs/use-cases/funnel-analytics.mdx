## What Funnel Analytics Shows You

CreatorCommerce Funnel Analytics gives you self-serve visibility into the complete co-branded shopping funnel — from the moment a shopper lands on a creator's page to the moment they check out.

This replaces the guesswork of "did the campaign work?" with granular data on where shoppers convert, drop off, and what drives revenue.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Tracks |
|--------|---------------|
| **Revenue** | Total sales attributed to co-branded funnels |
| **Conversion Rate (CVR)** | Percentage of visitors who purchase |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | Average spend per order through creator funnels |
| **New Customer %** | Percentage of orders from first-time buyers |
| **Step-by-Step Breakdown** | Performance at each funnel stage |

## Filtering

View analytics across multiple dimensions:

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **By Campaign** | Compare performance across campaigns |
| **By Date Range** | Track trends over time |
| **By Creator** | Identify top performers |
| **By Destination** | Compare landing page types |

## Funnel Steps

The analytics track shoppers through each stage:

```
Landing Page Visit → Product View → Add to Cart → Checkout → Purchase
```

At each step, you can see:
- Volume (how many shoppers reached this step)
- Drop-off rate (how many left at this step)
- Conversion to next step (percentage who continued)

## What to Look For

### High Landing Page Visits, Low Product Views
**Diagnosis:** Landing page isn't compelling enough to drive exploration.
**Actions:**
- Improve hero section and creator UGC
- Add clearer product CTAs
- Test different landing page templates

### High Product Views, Low Add-to-Cart
**Diagnosis:** Product pages aren't converting affiliate traffic.
**Actions:**
- Add creator context to product pages (notes, reviews, media)
- Display the discount prominently
- Use personalized product recommendations from the creator's drops

### High Add-to-Cart, Low Purchase
**Diagnosis:** Checkout friction.
**Actions:**
- Verify discount code is auto-applying
- Check for conflicting pop-ups or distractions
- Ensure checkout reflects the co-branded experience
- Review shipping costs and threshold messaging

### Strong CVR but Low AOV
**Diagnosis:** Shoppers buy but don't buy enough.
**Actions:**
- Enable bundles and multi-product drops
- Add "Complete the look" or "Shop the collection" CTAs
- Display savings on higher-quantity purchases

## Benchmarks

Based on CreatorCommerce brand data:

| Metric | Standard Affiliate | Co-branded Funnel | Uplift |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| CVR | 1.5–3% | 4–8% | 2–3x |
| AOV | Baseline | +30–70% | Significant |
| New Customer % | 40–60% | 50–75% | Higher |

<Note>
These benchmarks vary by industry. Fashion and beauty tend to see higher AOV lifts. Health and wellness see stronger new customer acquisition.

## Using Analytics to Optimize

### Weekly Review
1. Check top 5 creators by revenue — are they consistent?
2. Look at funnel drop-off — where are you losing shoppers?
3. Compare CVR across campaigns — what's different about the top performer?

### Monthly Review
1. Trend analysis — is the channel growing?
2. Creator tier analysis — which tier delivers the best ROI?
3. Landing page template comparison — which layouts convert best?
4. New customer cost — is the creator channel more efficient than paid?

### Campaign Post-Mortem
After each campaign, review:
- Total attributed revenue
- Cost of the campaign (commission + retainers + seeding)
- Contribution margin
- Top and bottom performing creators
- Funnel bottleneck identification
