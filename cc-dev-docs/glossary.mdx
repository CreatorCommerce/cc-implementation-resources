## Core Concepts

### Creator
An individual who collaborates with brands to promote and sell products. Also referred to as:
- Influencer
- Ambassador
- Affiliate
- Practitioner
- Partner

Creators have profiles, drops, and collaborations with channels (brands). Creator data is stored in Shopify metaobjects of type `creator`.

- `socials` - Social media profiles
- `tags` - Classification tags

### Channel

## Shopify Integration

### Metaobject
A Shopify metaobject of type `creator` that stores creator data and syncs with CreatorCommerce backend.

**Key Metaobject Fields:**
- Top-level fields: Direct access (e.g., `cc-creator-first-name`)
- `data.value` - JSON structure containing all creator data including:
  - `cc-creator-drops` - Drops as JSON with order and custom fields
  - All top-level fields duplicated for consistency

**Access Patterns:**
```liquid
{# On metaobject page templates #}
{{ metaobject.cc-creator-first-name }}

{# On other pages/sections #}
{% assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle'] %}
{% assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle] %}
{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}
```

### Shopify IDs
GIDs (Global IDs) used to reference Shopify objects.

**Common ID Types:**
- `shopifyCreatorMetaobjectId` - Creator metaobject GID
- `shopifyCreatorCollectionId` - Creator's collection GID
- `shopifyCustomerId` - Customer account GID
- `shopifyProductId` - Product GID
- `shopifyVariantId` - Product variant GID

**Format:** `gid://shopify/{Type}/{NumericId}` (e.g., `gid://shopify/Metaobject/77942685991`)

### Collection
Shopify collection representing a creator's drops. Each drop maps to a Shopify collection containing the drop's products.

**Relationship:**
- Drop → Shopify Collection (via `shopifyCreatorCollectionId`)
- Collection contains products from the drop
- Products can be accessed via Shopify's collection API

## Custom Fields

### Custom Field Structure
Flexible key-value storage for collabs, drops, and products. Allows brands to add custom metadata beyond standard fields.

**Field Types:**
- **Short form** - Single-line text
- **Long form** - Multi-line text (rich text)
- **Single media** - One media file
- **List media** - Array of media files
- **Nested structures** - Objects and arrays

**Naming Convention:**
Custom fields typically prefixed with `cc-` (e.g., `cc-hero-header`, `cc-product-short-form-2`)

**Access in Liquid:**
```liquid
{# Collab custom fields #}
{{ cc_creator.custom['cc-hero-header'] }}

{# Drop custom fields #}
{{ drop.custom['cc-drop-short-form-2'] }}

{# Product custom fields (in drops) #}
{{ product.custom['cc-product-short-form-2'] }}
```

## Enrichment & Workflows

### Enrichment Workflow
Automated processes that enhance data based on events or schedules. Used to sync data between CreatorCommerce and Shopify, update metaobjects, and trigger notifications.

**Common Enrichment Patterns:**
- Cart attributes → Metaobject updates
- New collab → Shopify collection creation
- Drop creation → Product collection updates
- Purchase events → Attribution tracking

### Conversion Flow
Workflow triggered by purchase events to attribute sales to creators and update analytics.

**Typical Steps:**
1. Cart checkout with `cc-creator-id` attribute
2. Purchase event captured
3. Attribution assigned to creator
4. Analytics updated
5. Creator notified (if configured)

### Enrollment Flow
Workflow for onboarding new creators and setting up collaborations.

**Typical Steps:**
1. Creator invitation (magic link)
2. Creator signup/authentication
3. Collab creation
4. Metaobject initialization
5. Shopify collection creation
6. Creator dashboard access granted

## Co-Branded Experiences

### Co-Branded Storefront
A personalized storefront experience that incorporates creator branding, recommended products, and custom messaging. Built using Liquid templates that reference creator metaobjects.

**Key Components:**
- Creator profile information
- Drops/product recommendations
- Creator-specific messaging
- Discount code display
- Brand + creator co-branding

### Creator Page
A dedicated page for a creator (metaobject page template) showcasing their profile, drops, and recommended products.

**URL Pattern:** `/pages/{creator-handle}` or metaobject page URL

### Dynamic Text Processing
Liquid snippets that process dynamic text with creator-specific placeholders and personalization.

**Common Patterns:**
- Replace placeholders with creator data
- Handle missing values gracefully
- Support multi-level fallbacks

## Common Field Patterns

### Creator Fields

## Best Practices

### Data Resolution Order
1. Creator metaobject (primary source)
2. Section/block settings (configurable defaults)
3. Neutral/fallback values

### ID Type Conversion
Always convert IDs to strings when comparing:
```liquid
{# ❌ Wrong - type mismatch #}
{% if product.id == drop_product_id %}

{# ✅ Correct - convert to string #}
{% if product.id | append: '' == drop_product_id %}
```

### Graceful Fallbacks
Always handle missing data:
```liquid
{% assign creator_name = cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name | default: 'Creator' %}
{% if cc_creator and cc_creator.cc-creator-drops %}
  {# Safe to access drops #}
{% endif %}
```
