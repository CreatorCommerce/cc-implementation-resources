The CreatorCommerce Unified API provides a comprehensive interface for managing creators, collaborations, drops, and checkout URLs. This API enables you to integrate CreatorCommerce functionality into your applications.

## Base URL

## Authentication

The API supports two authentication methods:

1. **Bearer Token (JWT)** - For authenticated user requests
2. **API Key** - Using `x-channel-access-token` or `x-partner-access-token` headers

See the [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication) for detailed information.
