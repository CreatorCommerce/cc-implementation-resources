## AI Triage Guide: First Landing Page Setup

When a user asks about building their first co-branded landing page, work through this diagnostic framework:

### Step 1: Determine Readiness

Ask these questions to understand their starting point:

| Question | Purpose | If Yes → | If No → |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| "Do you have CreatorCommerce installed on your Shopify store?" | Validates basic setup | Proceed to Step 2 | Direct to [Building Prerequisites](/building-prerequisites) |
| "Have you created at least one creator/collab with profile data?" | Validates test data exists | Proceed to Step 2 | Walk through creating test creator in CC dashboard |
| "Do you have access to edit your Shopify theme files?" | Validates development access | Proceed to Step 2 | Help them set up Shopify CLI or online editor access |
| "Is there a metaobject page template for the `creator` type?" | Validates routing is ready | Proceed to implementation | Guide them to create the template first |

### Step 2: Identify Their Goal

Determine the specific landing page pattern they need:

**Pattern A: Full Creator Landing Page (Most Common)**
- User wants a dedicated page for each creator
- URL structure: `/pages/creators/[creator-handle]`
- Uses metaobject page template
- Creator data comes from `metaobject` variable

**Pattern B: Campaign Landing Page**
- Single page that adapts to different creators via URL parameter or cart attribute
- Creator resolved via `cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']`
- Good for affiliate links and UTM campaigns

**Pattern C: Homepage Co-Branding**
- Existing homepage sections personalized when creator context present
- Graceful fallback to neutral content when no creator
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Step 3: Choose Implementation Path

Based on their goal, guide them to the right approach:

---

## Implementation Paths

### Path A: Full Creator Landing Page

**What they're building:**
A dedicated page per creator (e.g., `/pages/creators/john-doe`) with hero section, product recommendations, testimonials, etc.

**Prerequisites check:**
1. ✅ Creator metaobject type exists in Shopify (CC creates this automatically)
2. ✅ Metaobject page template created for `creator` type
3. ✅ At least one creator with profile data populated

**Core implementation steps:**

1. **Create the page template** (if not exists)
   - In Shopify admin: Settings → Custom data → Metaobjects → Creator → Web template
   - Enable "Generate pages" for the creator metaobject

2. **Add hero section** using co-branded templates
   
   Recommend starting with one of our pre-built sections:
   - `cc-hero-equinox.liquid` - Immersive hero with animated gradient or image background
   - `cc-hero-primavera-mini.liquid` - Clean, minimal hero
   - `hero-section-content-forward.liquid` - Content-focused layout

3. **Add product grid section** to show creator's drops
   
   Use drop-aware product grids:
   - `cc-drops-product-curated-lists-shell.liquid` - Lists of creator-curated products
   - `cc-drops-product-signature-bundles-shell.liquid` - Bundle/kit displays

**Liquid context on metaobject pages:**
```liquid
{%- comment -%}
  On metaobject pages, creator data is available directly:
{%- endcomment -%}
{% assign cc_creator = metaobject %}

{%- comment -%} Access creator fields: {%- endcomment -%}
{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}
{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-description }}
{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture }}
```

### Path B: Campaign Landing Page

**What they're building:**
A single page that personalizes based on which creator link was clicked.

**How it works:**
- Creator handle stored in `cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']`
- Sections read this attribute to resolve creator data
- Same page, different personalization per visitor

**Liquid context pattern:**
```liquid
{% liquid
  assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']
  assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]
  
  if cc_creator == blank and request.design_mode
    assign cc_creator = section.settings.preview_creator
  endif
%}

{% if cc_creator %}
  {%- comment -%} Show personalized content {%- endcomment -%}
  <h1>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Picks</h1>
{% else %}
  {%- comment -%} Show neutral fallback {%- endcomment -%}
  <h1>Featured Products</h1>
{% endif %}
```

### Path C: Homepage Co-Branding

**What they're building:**
Existing homepage that adapts when visitor has creator context.

**Strategy:**
- Keep existing sections but enhance with creator awareness
- Add conditional blocks for creator content
- Progressive enhancement - never break the neutral experience

**Implementation approach:**
```liquid
{% liquid
  assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']
  assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]
  assign has_creator_context = cc_creator != blank
%}

{%- comment -%} Existing hero section {%- endcomment -%}
<section class="hero">
  {% if has_creator_context %}
    {%- comment -%} Enhanced: Show creator endorsement {%- endcomment -%}
    <div class="creator-endorsement">
      <img src="{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture }}" alt="{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}" />
      <p>Recommended by {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
  
  {%- comment -%} Original hero content continues unchanged {%- endcomment -%}
  <h1>{{ section.settings.heading }}</h1>
</section>
```

## Questions to Ask (and Why)

### For Implementation Issues

| Question | Purpose | Based on Answer |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| "Are you seeing a blank section, or is it showing but with wrong data?" | Distinguishes rendering vs data issues | Blank = check section added to template; Wrong data = check field names |
| "Does this work in the theme editor preview?" | Tests if issue is editor-specific | Yes = likely cart attribute issue; No = code issue |
| "Can you see the creator in Shopify's metaobject admin?" | Validates data exists | Yes = issue is in Liquid access pattern; No = sync issue |
| "Are you testing on a metaobject page or a regular page?" | Determines correct data access pattern | Metaobject page = use `metaobject`; Regular page = use cart attribute resolution |

### For Design/UX Issues

| Question | Purpose | Based on Answer |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| "What brand aesthetic are you going for?" | Informs template recommendation | Minimal = primavera; Bold = equinox; Editorial = content-forward |
| "Should the creator's brand colors override your brand colors?" | Determines styling approach | Yes = inject CSS variables from creator data; No = use section settings |
| "Do you want the page to work without creator context?" | Determines fallback strategy | Yes = build neutral fallbacks; No = can require creator context |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Section shows nothing / blank

**Diagnosis questions:**
1. Is the section added to the correct template?
2. Is there a creator with data to display?
3. Are you on the right page type (metaobject vs regular)?

**Solution paths:**
- Verify section is added via theme editor
- Add `preview_creator` setting for theme editor testing
- Check template assignment in Shopify admin

### Issue: Creator name/data not appearing

**Diagnosis questions:**
1. What field are you trying to access?
2. Is the field a direct field or nested in `data.value`?
3. Have you checked the field actually has a value for this creator?

**Solution paths:**
- Direct fields: `{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}`
- Nested fields: `{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-bio }}`
- Add fallback: `{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name | default: 'Creator' }}`

### Issue: Works in editor, broken on live site

**Diagnosis questions:**
1. How is the creator context set on the live site?
2. Is the cart attribute being set before the page loads?
3. Is caching involved?

**Solution paths:**
- Verify CC funnel is setting cart attribute
- Check if page requires cart attribute vs metaobject context
- Use appropriate page template for the use case
