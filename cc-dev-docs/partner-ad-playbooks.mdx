## Why Partner Ads Work

Traditional affiliate links send traffic to a generic PDP. Partner ads pair **paid amplification** with **co-branded funnels** — the ad drives attention, the funnel converts it. The result is higher ROAS on ad spend and deeper creator relationships.

These three playbooks combine recruitment platforms, paid media, and CreatorCommerce storefronts into full-loop strategies.

## Playbook 1: Dominate Local Markets with B2B Partner Ads

**Best for:** Brands with local or regional audiences — wellness, fitness, beauty, food — partnering with solopreneurs, hairstylists, trainers, nutritionists, and local legends.

### The Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Onboard Local Partners">
    Use your affiliate or recruitment platform to onboard solopreneurs and local professionals. Focus on people with real, trusted relationships in their community — not follower counts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Ads with Local Hooks">
    Create paid ads (Meta, Google) with localized creative:
    - "Portland's favorite nutritionist recommends these supplements"
    - "Trusted by your local trainer — shop their picks"

    Use the partner's likeness and endorsement in the ad creative (with whitelisting authorization).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Funnel into Co-branded Landers">
    Ads point to the partner's CreatorCommerce landing page on your Shopify store. The shopper lands on a page branded around the local business — their photo, bio, picks, and discount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Up with Co-branded Emails">
    Cart abandonment and post-purchase emails reference both your brand **and** the local partner. The familiar name drives higher open rates and win-backs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why It Works

- **Local trust is the highest-converting trust.** People buy from people they know in their community.
- **Low cost of acquisition.** Local partners often accept lower commission because the exposure is valuable to their business.
- **Defensible moat.** Competitors can't poach a relationship built on local community ties.

## Playbook 2: Seed Content for Paid Amplification

**Best for:** Brands that need high-quality UGC for paid media and want to build an engine that generates content while also driving affiliate revenue.

### The Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Creators via Meta Search and DMs">
    Use Meta's AI search or discovery tools to find creators in your niche. DM them with a compelling offer:
    - Free product (seeding)
    - Chance to have their content boosted with ad spend
    - Commission on any sales generated

    **The offer:** "We'll send you product for free. If you submit content and authorize us for whitelisting, we guarantee $200 in ad spend behind your content plus 5% commission on sales."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collect Content and Whitelisting Authorization">
    Use CreatorCommerce forms to collect:
    - Product review content (video, photos)
    - Whitelisting authorization (Meta partnership ads)
    - Their honest take on the product
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Partnership Ads">
    Set up the approved content as partnership ads (formerly known as whitelisted or spark ads). The ad runs from the creator's account with your budget behind it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Funnel into Product Review Landers">
    Ads point to a CreatorCommerce landing page featuring:
    - The creator's review and content
    - Product details with the creator's discount
    - Social proof from the creator's endorsement
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Up with Co-branded Emails">
    Cart abandonment emails reference the creator and their review. Post-purchase emails reinforce the trust-based relationship.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why It Works

- **Content engine.** Every creator you seed becomes a content supplier.
- **Performance-based spend.** Only boost content that passes quality review.
- **Compounding value.** The same creator drives affiliate revenue AND supplies paid media creative.

## Playbook 3: Earn a Celebrity Endorsement

**Best for:** Brands that want to build long-term, high-value creator relationships by offering a clear path from affiliate to brand ambassador.

### The Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Offer Every New Partner a Career Path">
    When creators join your program, position the relationship as a progression — not a static commission deal:

    - **Level 1:** Affiliate (commission + discount code)
    - **Level 2:** Featured creator (higher commission + co-branded storefront)
    - **Level 3:** Brand ambassador (retainer + ad spend + theme takeover)

    Make the milestones clear: content deliverables, sales targets, engagement metrics.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Email the Roadmap">
    Send new creators an email outlining exactly what it takes to level up:
    - Content requirements per month
    - Sales milestones to hit
    - Engagement benchmarks
    - What they unlock at each level (ad spend commitment, premium storefront, exclusivity)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enroll Top Performers in Partner Ads">
    When a creator hits their milestone, unlock paid amplification behind their content. This is the big incentive — your ad budget making their content reach a much larger audience.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Spin Up Theme Takeovers">
    For top-tier creators, build a fully branded storefront experience using CreatorCommerce destinations:
    - Their branding dominates the page
    - Full product catalog or curated selection
    - Custom landing page template
    - Dedicated email flows in their name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Material Ad Spend">
    The final incentive: a committed ad budget behind their content and storefront. Share performance data so they can see the impact. This creates a genuine partnership where both sides are invested.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why It Works

- **Retention through aspiration.** Creators stay because there's always a next level to unlock.
- **Performance-gated investment.** You only spend heavily on proven performers.
- **Celebrity-level output at affiliate-level cost.** By the time a creator earns ambassador status, their content and conversion data are proven.
