---

When building co-branded creator experiences, you'll work across a spectrum from temporary, testable funnels to permanent, partner-owned shops. Understanding this spectrum helps you choose the right approach for each collaboration and manage assets appropriately.

## The Spectrum

CreatorCommerce supports two primary approaches to co-branded experiences:

1. **Ethereal Funnels** - Temporary, testable experiences that come and go
2. **Dedicated Shops** - Permanent, partner-owned assets with ongoing ownership

## Ethereal Funnels

Ethereal funnels are temporary, flexible experiences designed for testing, campaigns, and short-term collaborations. They're perfect for experimentation and rapid iteration.

### Characteristics
