## What You Can Do

Build integrations that sync creator/collab data between CreatorCommerce and tools like CRMs, affiliate platforms, ESPs, analytics systems, and internal ops tools.

Common outcomes:

- Keep partner records in sync across platforms
- Trigger external workflows from creator/collab state changes
- Enrich CreatorCommerce data from external systems
- Feed attribution and performance data into your reporting stack
