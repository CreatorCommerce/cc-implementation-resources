title: 'Build for Your Personas'
description: 'Stop building for edge cases. Know exactly who you serve and build precisely for them.'
---

Most software is over-engineered for users who don't exist. Features for edge cases. Flexibility for scenarios that never happen. Abstractions for extensibility no one needs.

When you build on the critical path, you build for real people—your specific personas—and nothing else.

## The Edge Case Trap

Every "what if" carries a cost:

- **"What if someone wants to..."** — Feature complexity
- **"What if we need to support..."** — Technical debt
- **"What if they have edge case X..."** — Testing burden
- **"What if in the future..."** — Over-abstraction

These add up. Soon you're maintaining a complex system that serves everyone poorly instead of a focused system that serves your personas perfectly.

## Know Your Personas

Before writing code, know exactly who you're building for:

### Partner Personas

Who are your partners?

| Persona | Characteristics | What They Need |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Micro-influencer** | 5K-50K followers, authentic, time-poor | One-click setup, automatic content |
| **Professional** | Doctor, trainer, expert—credibility matters | Polished presence, deep customization |
| **Content creator** | Full-time, sophisticated, high expectations | Advanced tools, detailed analytics |
| **Casual ambassador** | Customer turned fan, low maintenance | Simple sharing, automatic updates |

### Consumer Personas

Who visits partner pages?

| Persona | Journey | What They Need |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Warm lead** | Clicked partner's link, already interested | Fast loading, clear value prop, easy purchase |
| **Researcher** | Comparing options, needs convincing | Social proof, product details, partner credibility |
| **Repeat buyer** | Knows the brand, here for the deal | Quick checkout, remembered preferences |

## Build Precisely for Them

### 1. Feature Decisions

Instead of "what features should we build?" ask "what do our personas need?"

**For micro-influencers:**
- ✅ Auto-generated landing pages
- ✅ One-click product selection
- ✅ Mobile-first dashboard
- ❌ Complex customization tools
- ❌ Detailed analytics dashboards

**For professionals:**
- ✅ Credibility-focused layouts
- ✅ Bio and credentials display
- ✅ Professional imagery
- ❌ "Influencer" language
- ❌ Playful, casual tone

### 2. UX Decisions

Every interaction should feel natural for your personas:

```liquid
{% comment %} 
  For busy micro-influencers, auto-populate everything 
  Don't ask questions you can answer yourself
{% endcomment %}

{% assign first_name = cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name %}
{% assign top_products = cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-drops[0].cc-creator-drop-products | slice: 0, 4 %}

<section class="cc-auto-curated">
  <h2>{{ first_name }}'s Top Picks</h2>
  {% for product in top_products %}
    {% render 'product-card', product: product %}
  {% endfor %}
</section>
```

### 3. Copy Decisions

Words matter. Match your personas' vocabulary:

| Generic | Micro-influencer | Professional |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| "Your affiliate page" | "Your shop" | "Your practice storefront" |
| "Earn commission" | "Get rewarded" | "Professional partnership" |
| "Share your link" | "Share with your community" | "Recommend to patients" |

### 4. Design Decisions

Visual design should resonate with your personas:

- **Micro-influencers:** Fun, social, mobile-native
- **Professionals:** Clean, credible, trustworthy
- **Content creators:** Sophisticated, customizable, on-brand

## The Benefits of Constraint

Building for specific personas isn't limiting—it's liberating:

### 1. Faster Decisions

"Should we build X?" becomes "Do our personas need X?"

### 2. Clearer Priorities

When you know who you serve, priority debates resolve themselves.

### 3. Better Quality

Energy focused on fewer features = higher quality per feature.

### 4. Stronger Positioning

"We're perfect for X" is more compelling than "We work for everyone."

## Practical Exercise

For your next feature:

1. **Name the persona** — Who specifically is this for?
2. **Describe their context** — What are they doing when they use this?
3. **Define success** — How do they know it worked?
4. **Identify what they don't need** — What can we leave out?

If you can't answer these questions, you're not ready to build.

## The CreatorCommerce Advantage

CreatorCommerce's data model already knows about personas:

- **Partner segments** — Different tiers and types
- **Collab tiers** — Different partnership levels
- **Custom fields** — Persona-specific data
- **Conditional rendering** — Show different content to different personas

Use these to build precisely, not generically.

```liquid
{% case cc_creator.cc-partner-type %}
  {% when 'professional' %}
    {% render 'professional-hero', creator: cc_creator %}
  {% when 'influencer' %}
    {% render 'influencer-hero', creator: cc_creator %}
  {% else %}
    {% render 'default-hero', creator: cc_creator %}
{% endcase %}
```

**Build for who you serve. Ignore everyone else.**
