title: 'Design Your Data'

Data design is creative work. Deciding what to capture, how to structure it, and how it flows through your system—these are design decisions as important as any visual choice.

But traditionally, every data decision carries implementation burden: schemas, migrations, APIs, validation, security. The dread of backend work suppresses data creativity.

CreatorCommerce removes that dread.

## The Traditional Burden

When you think "I want to store X," your brain immediately calculates:

1. **Schema design** — What's the right data type? Relationships?
2. **Migration** — How do I add this to production?
3. **API endpoints** — How will the frontend access this?
4. **Validation** — How do I ensure data integrity?
5. **Security** — Who can read/write this?
6. **Performance** — Will this query be fast enough?

By the time you're done calculating, you've often decided "not worth it" and moved on.

## The CreatorCommerce Approach

With CreatorCommerce, you think about data without backend burden:

### Shopify Metaobjects: Your Database

All CC data lives in Shopify's native metaobject system:

- **No separate database** — Data lives where your store lives
- **No sync logic** — It's already in Shopify
- **No backup concerns** — Shopify handles durability
- **No access control setup** — Uses Shopify's permission model
- **Automatic API access** — Query via Storefront or Admin API

### Structured Data (Metaobjects)

The platform provides rich data structures:

- **Creator data** — Profile, bio, images, social links
- **Collab data** — Discount codes, commission rates, tiers
- **Drop data** — Curated products, collections, featured items
- **Custom fields** — Whatever you need, added via dashboard

No schema migrations. No API development. Just use it.

### Integrations Auto-Sync

When you update data in CC, it automatically flows to connected platforms:

- **Klaviyo** — Creator profiles sync as contact properties
- **Attentive** — Customer attribution updates in real-time
- **Shopify Flow** — Triggers fire on data changes
- **Your theme** — Liquid templates render the latest data

No webhooks to build. No sync jobs to maintain. No data consistency bugs to debug.

### Accessing Your Data

```liquid
{% comment %} This just works. No backend required. {% endcomment %}

{% assign creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle] %}
{% assign bio = creator.cc-creator-bio %}
{% assign drops = creator.data.value.cc-creator-drops %}
{% assign custom_field = creator.data.value.my-custom-field %}
```

### Extending With Custom Fields

Need to track something new? Add a custom field:

- Shoe size for fashion influencers
- Specialty for medical professionals
- Audience size tier
- Content format preference

No deployment. No database work. Just add it and use it.

## Think Deeply About Data

With the burden removed, you can think creatively about data:

### What Stories Can You Tell?

Think about data as narrative building blocks:

- **Origin story** — How did this partner discover you?
- **Journey data** — What's their progression been?
- **Impact metrics** — How much value have they created?
- **Relationship depth** — What makes this partnership special?

### What Personalization Can You Enable?

Data enables personalization:

- **Aesthetic preferences** — Color, style, tone
- **Audience characteristics** — Who follows this partner?
- **Content strengths** — What type of content do they create?
- **Product affinities** — What categories resonate with their audience?

### What Automation Can You Power?

The right data enables intelligent automation:

- **Smart defaults** — Pre-populate based on partner type
- **Dynamic content** — Generate copy from data
- **Conditional flows** — Different journeys for different segments
- **AI enhancement** — Let AI work with rich context

## Data Design Principles

### 1. Capture Intent, Not Just Facts

Don't just store what happened. Store why:

| Fact | Intent |
|------|--------|
| "Product A selected" | "Partner's top recommendation" |
| "Created January 2024" | "Early adopter, founding partner" |
| "Commission rate 15%" | "Premium tier, proven performer" |

### 2. Design for Querying

Think about how you'll use data, not just store it:

```liquid
{% comment %} 
  Bad: Partner type stored as free text
  Hard to query, inconsistent values
{% endcomment %}

{% comment %} 
  Good: Partner type as structured field
  Easy to filter, consistent values
{% endcomment %}

{% if creator.partner-type == 'professional' %}
  {% render 'professional-layout' %}
{% endif %}
```

### 3. Plan for Evolution

Your data needs will change. Design for extensibility:

- Use custom fields for experimental data
- Keep core schema stable
- Version your data structure mentally

### 4. Consider Privacy

Not all data should be stored. Ask:

- Do we need this?
- How long do we need it?
- Who should access it?
- What would partners expect?

## Practical Examples

### Partner Segmentation

```liquid
{% comment %} Rich segmentation data enables personalized experiences {% endcomment %}

{% assign segment = creator.data.value.partner-segment %}
{% assign tier = creator.data.value.partner-tier %}
{% assign persona = creator.data.value.audience-persona %}

{% case segment %}
  {% when 'health-professional' %}
    {% render 'health-pro-hero', 
      credentials: creator.data.value.credentials,
      specialty: creator.data.value.specialty %}
  {% when 'lifestyle-influencer' %}
    {% render 'influencer-hero',
      aesthetic: creator.data.value.aesthetic-preference %}
{% endcase %}
```

### Dynamic Content Generation

```liquid
{% comment %} Data powers intelligent defaults {% endcomment %}

{% assign products = creator.data.value.cc-creator-drops[0].cc-creator-drop-products %}
{% assign first_product = products[0] %}
{% assign partner_style = creator.data.value.content-style %}

<section class="cc-featured" data-style="{{ partner_style }}">
  <h2>
    {% if partner_style == 'casual' %}
      My absolute favorite 🙌
    {% elsif partner_style == 'professional' %}
      My top recommendation for patients
    {% else %}
      {{ creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Pick
    {% endif %}
  </h2>
</section>
```

## The Freedom to Experiment

When data design is free, you experiment more:

- "What if we tracked aesthetic preferences?"
- "What if we captured audience demographics?"
- "What if we stored partner content preferences?"

Each experiment is a checkbox in a dashboard, not a sprint of engineering work.

**That's how you build data-rich experiences: by removing the cost of data decisions.**
