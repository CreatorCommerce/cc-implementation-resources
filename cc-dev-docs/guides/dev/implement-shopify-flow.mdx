        { "property": "cc_tier", "value": "{{ partner.tier }}" },
        { "property": "cc_total_orders", "value": "{{ partner.metrics.totalOrders }}" }
      ]
    }
```

  template_data:
    partner_name: "{{ partner.firstName }}"
    order_value: "{{ attribution.orderValue | money }}"
    commission: "{{ attribution.commissionAmount | money }}"
