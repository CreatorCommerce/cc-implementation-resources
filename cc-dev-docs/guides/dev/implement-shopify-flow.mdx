## Overview

CreatorCommerce integrates with Shopify Flow so you can react to creator/collab updates and sync data across Shopify and external systems.

## Current Trigger Availability

| Trigger | Fires When |
|---------|------------|
| `CreatorCommerce - Creator Updated` | A creator/collab record is updated in CreatorCommerce |

### Trigger Variables (Currently Available)

- `ccCreatorId` (String)
- `ccCreatorShopId` (String)
- `ccCreatorMetaobjectId` (String)
- `ccCreatorShopHandle` (String)
- `ccCreatorDiscountCode` (String)
- `ccCreatorAffiliateCode` (String)
- `ccCreatorAffiliateUrl` (String)
- `ccCreatorShopHandlePrev` (String)
- `ccCreatorDiscountCodePrev` (String)
- `ccCreatorAffiliateCodePrev` (String)
- `ccCreatorAffiliateUrlPrev` (String)

## Current Action Availability

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| `Sync Tier Assignment with CreatorCommerce` | Syncs creator and tier information into CreatorCommerce (typically from Shopify Collabs variables, but can also use custom data). |

### Action Inputs (Currently Available)

- `First Name`
- `Last Name`
- `Email`
- `Location`
- `Tier Name`
- `Affiliate Code`
- `Community Member Id`
- `Primary Username`
- `MyShopify Domain`

## Example Flows

### 1) Sync Creator From Shopify Collabs

```
Trigger: Shopify Collabs event
Action: Sync Tier Assignment with CreatorCommerce
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - Tier Name
  - Affiliate Code
  - Community Member Id
  - Primary Username
  - MyShopify Domain
```

### 2) React to Affiliate Code Changes

```
Trigger: CreatorCommerce - Creator Updated
Condition: ccCreatorAffiliateCode != ccCreatorAffiliateCodePrev
Action: Send Slack notification
Action: Update external CRM/ESP profile
```

### 3) React to Shop Handle Changes

```
Trigger: CreatorCommerce - Creator Updated
Condition: ccCreatorShopHandle != ccCreatorShopHandlePrev
Action: Update link destinations and campaign metadata
```

## Setup Steps

1. Go to Shopify Admin -> Apps -> Flow.
2. Create a workflow and choose either:
   - a Shopify Collabs trigger (to drive the sync action), or
   - `CreatorCommerce - Creator Updated` (to drive downstream automations).
3. Add `Sync Tier Assignment with CreatorCommerce` when you need to write/update creator collab data in CC.
4. Map trigger variables to the action input fields.
5. Add conditions/actions for downstream systems (Slack, Klaviyo, CRM, HTTP request, etc.).
6. Test with a real creator update and confirm variable values in Flow run logs.

- Treat this page as current-state availability.
- If new triggers/actions are added, update this guide and the references together.
