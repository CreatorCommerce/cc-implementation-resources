## What You Can Do

Turn standard Shopify templates into creator-aware experiences by resolving `cc_creator` and injecting co-branded context across:

- Landing pages
- Product pages
- Product lists/drops
- Popups
- Cart and checkout messaging

You can choose between:

- Out-of-the-box CC sections for speed
- Converting existing theme sections for tighter brand continuity
- Net-new funnel builds for maximum control
