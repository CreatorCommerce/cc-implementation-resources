description: 'Build a net-new co-branded funnel from scratch using CreatorCommerce, with a conversion-focused checklist for launch.'
---

## When To Use This Path

Use this when you are not adapting existing sections and want a purpose-built funnel from first principles for creator/affiliate traffic.

## Core Build Goal

Create a mobile-first, creator-native landing experience that carries creator trust through product selection, cart, checkout, and lifecycle messaging.

## Compounding Funnel Study (10 Rounds)

Use this section to compound strategy from high-performing ecommerce patterns. Each round should:

1. Extract reusable UX patterns from the source.
2. Map each pattern to glossary components.
3. Translate the pattern into co-branded CreatorCommerce adaptations.
4. Add only net-new blocks/copy logic that improve conversion continuity.

### Round 1: Fashion / Apparel / Accessories (Home)

#### Observed Pattern Stack

1. **Arrive -> orient -> reassure:** fast global routing with mega-menu + persistent utility actions.
2. **Category-first pathing:** home pushes users to category trees before deep PDP commitment.
3. **Intent to consideration:** best-seller merchandising + variant depth affordances.
4. **Cart momentum:** reassurance in bag UI (pickup/fulfillment confidence + continue shopping fallback).
5. **Retention loop:** owned-channel capture (email + app).

#### Glossary Mapping (Core Terms)

- `Header`
- `Mega menu`
- `Search bar`
- `Mini cart`
- `Category grid`
- `Featured collection`
- `Best sellers`
- `Wishlist button`
- `Email signup`

#### Co-Branded Adaptation Layer

3. Convert best-seller cards to include **Creator recommendation badges** plus quick wishlist.
4. Show **Creator cart banner** in drawer/cart with creator-linked pickup or shipping reassurance copy.
5. Attach email/app capture to creator context so lifecycle messaging can trigger:
   - `Marketing Opt In From Creator`
   - `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
   - `Creator Attributed Order`

#### Implementation Focus (Round 1 Baseline)

2. **Promo-first commercial framing:** place a strong promo strip early so price-sensitive users get a reason to continue.
3. **Collection CTA ladder:** stack multiple collection-entry CTAs (`NEW ARRIVALS`, `NEW DRESSES`, etc.) to move users from browse to category depth.
4. **Bottom-funnel reassurance:** add fulfillment clarity (`free shipping threshold`, `duties/taxes may vary`) near footer and cart moments.

6. **Soft retention capture:** newsletter and early-access capture acts as a conversion safety net for non-buyers.

#### Glossary Mapping (Round 34 Additions)

- `Persona-led beauty hero`
- `Category-fast beauty routing`
- `Capsule-culture spotlight lane`
- `Curated beauty discovery teaser`
- `Empowerment-tone copy layer`
- `Beauty early-access capture`

#### Co-Branded Adaptation Layer (Round 34)

1. Keep persona-led hero creator-aware:
   - creator identity and brand aesthetic are presented as a shared narrative, not competing voices.
2. Use category-fast routing with creator merchandising:
   - creator-priority lanes for lips/eyes/face/sets based on creator intent.
3. Translate capsule-culture spotlight into creator collaboration windows:
   - creator-linked launch pages with clear open/close timing.
4. Keep curated teaser flow creator-specific:
   - first-scroll products reflect creator picks and creator routine entry points.
5. Pair empowerment tone with creator trust:
   - expressive brand language balanced by practical product guidance.

#### Implementation Focus (Round 34 Delta)

- In beauty homepages, lead with identity and quickly convert that identity into category decisions.
- Treat capsules as a repeatable merchandising engine, not one-off campaign art.
- Keep soft capture mechanisms active so browse-heavy traffic stays recoverable.

### Round 35: Beauty / Cosmetics (Product Page, Co-Branded Inspiration)

#### Net-New Pattern Stack (Compounding on Rounds 1-34)

1. **Foundation-first conversion rail:** PDP hero combines product identity, price, shade interaction, and immediate add-to-bag.
2. **AI shade-match micro-conversion:** shade-finder interaction serves as a confidence action before cart commitment.
3. **Inclusive shade-depth signal:** broad shade count acts as visible trust and inclusivity proof at decision time.
4. **Finish-wear demo loop:** finish/coverage demonstrations reinforce product outcome expectations before purchase.
5. **Ethical-performance reassurance:** vegan/cruelty-free standards are paired with finish and wear claims for balanced conviction.
6. **Complexion-system cross-sell:** matching concealers/tools are presented as coordinated complexion flow, not random add-ons.

#### Glossary Mapping (Round 35 Additions)

- `Foundation-first conversion rail`
- `AI shade-match micro-conversion`
- `Inclusive shade-depth signal`
- `Finish-wear demo loop`
- `Ethical-performance reassurance`
- `Complexion-system cross-sell`

#### Co-Branded Adaptation Layer (Round 35)

1. Keep foundation conversion rail creator-aware:
   - creator context persists through shade selection and add-to-bag.
2. Pair AI shade-match micro-conversion with creator proof:
   - creator examples support shade confidence for similar skin-tone audiences.
3. Use inclusive shade-depth signal with creator context:
   - creator messaging emphasizes range accessibility without overpromising exact-match outcomes.
4. Build finish-wear demo loop with creator wear tests:
   - creator-led application clips for finish, coverage, and wear over time.
5. Structure complexion cross-sell as creator routine bundles:
   - foundation + concealer + tool combinations mapped to creator looks.

#### Implementation Focus (Round 35 Delta)

- In foundation PDPs, treat shade confidence as the primary conversion blocker to solve first.
- Keep finish/wear proof concise and visually led to support rapid decision-making.
- Position ethical standards as reinforcement, not replacement, for performance proof.

## Net-New Funnel Checklist (Launch Standard)

### 1) Creator Trust, Social Proof, and Copy

- Use creator-specific UGC and testimonials (not generic brand social proof).
- Match copy tone to the creator voice (benefit-led, direct, emotional).
- Lead with the strongest creator-exclusive offer above the fold.
- Include creator-centric FAQ content that addresses real objections.
- Keep language simple and scannable.

### 2) Mobile UX, Visual Hierarchy, and Accessibility

- Design mobile-first (creator identity + offer visible before first swipe).
- Use clear font hierarchy (headline, support line, proof/quote).
- Ensure ADA basics: contrast, readable sizes, alt text, tappable controls.
- Match UI style to creator aesthetic while preserving brand consistency.
- Keep layout focused and low-friction.

### 3) Offer and Merchandising Strategy

- Make price and discount visually obvious.
- Show per-use economics when helpful.
- Present creator-curated picks in intentional order (hero item first).
- Add comparison framing where it clarifies the decision.
- Show exactly what is included (unboxing/value clarity).

### 4) Conversion Mechanics

- Keep path-to-checkout short and obvious.
- Preload creator-curated bundle/product where appropriate.
- Reinforce creator endorsement in cart/checkout.
- Offer BNPL where relevant.
- Use urgency only when real and compliant.

### 5) Messaging Capture and Lifecycle Continuity

- Use creator-context popups for email capture (start with minimal fields).
- Ensure captured emails retain creator association.
- Trigger B2C co-branded lifecycle events:
  - `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
  - `Creator Attributed Order`
  - `Marketing Opt In From Creator`
- Keep B2C customer messaging separate from B2B creator lifecycle flows.

### 6) Performance and QA

- Optimize media aggressively (especially creator videos/UGC).
- Target sub-second perceived load on high-intent entry pages.
- Use heatmaps/session replay to identify drop-off and iterate.
- Validate fallback states when creator context is missing.
- Run end-to-end tests from creator link click to post-purchase event logging.
