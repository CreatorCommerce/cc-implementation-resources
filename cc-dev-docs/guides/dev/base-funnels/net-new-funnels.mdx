## When To Use This Path

Use this when you are not adapting existing sections and want a purpose-built funnel from first principles for creator/affiliate traffic.

## Core Build Goal

Create a mobile-first, creator-native landing experience that carries creator trust through product selection, cart, checkout, and lifecycle messaging.

## Net-New Funnel Checklist (Launch Standard)

### 1) Creator Trust, Social Proof, and Copy

- Use creator-specific UGC and testimonials (not generic brand social proof).
- Match copy tone to the creator voice (benefit-led, direct, emotional).
- Lead with the strongest creator-exclusive offer above the fold.
- Include creator-centric FAQ content that addresses real objections.
- Keep language simple and scannable.

### 2) Mobile UX, Visual Hierarchy, and Accessibility

- Design mobile-first (creator identity + offer visible before first swipe).
- Use clear font hierarchy (headline, support line, proof/quote).
- Ensure ADA basics: contrast, readable sizes, alt text, tappable controls.
- Match UI style to creator aesthetic while preserving brand consistency.
- Keep layout focused and low-friction.

### 3) Offer and Merchandising Strategy

- Make price and discount visually obvious.
- Show per-use economics when helpful.
- Present creator-curated picks in intentional order (hero item first).
- Add comparison framing where it clarifies the decision.
- Show exactly what is included (unboxing/value clarity).

### 4) Conversion Mechanics

- Keep path-to-checkout short and obvious.
- Preload creator-curated bundle/product where appropriate.
- Reinforce creator endorsement in cart/checkout.
- Offer BNPL where relevant.
- Use urgency only when real and compliant.

### 5) Messaging Capture and Lifecycle Continuity

- Use creator-context popups for email capture (start with minimal fields).
- Ensure captured emails retain creator association.
- Trigger B2C co-branded lifecycle events:
  - `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
  - `Creator Attributed Order`
  - `Marketing Opt In From Creator`
- Keep B2C customer messaging separate from B2B creator lifecycle flows.

### 6) Performance and QA

- Optimize media aggressively (especially creator videos/UGC).
- Target sub-second perceived load on high-intent entry pages.
- Use heatmaps/session replay to identify drop-off and iterate.
- Validate fallback states when creator context is missing.
- Run end-to-end tests from creator link click to post-purchase event logging.
