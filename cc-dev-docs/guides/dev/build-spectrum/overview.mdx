description: 'Choose your level of customization—from out-of-the-box CC hosted to fully white-labeled platforms.'

CreatorCommerce offers a spectrum of build approaches. Start with zero-code hosted solutions and progressively customize toward fully white-labeled platforms—all running on the same CC infrastructure.

## Comparison

| Approach | Time to Launch | Customization | Maintenance | Best For |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| App Blocks | Minutes | Low | Zero | Quick start, testing |
| Theme Sections | Hours | Medium | Low | Brand consistency |
| Custom CSS | Days | Medium-High | Low | Design-forward brands |
| Headless API | Weeks | High | Medium | Custom experiences |
| White-Label | Months | Complete | Higher | Platform businesses |

## What Stays the Same

Regardless of where you are on the spectrum, you always get:

- **CC Data Model** — Creator, collab, drop data structure
- **Shopify-Native Storage** — Metaobjects in your store
- **Attribution Engine** — Order tracking and partner credit
- **Integration Layer** — Klaviyo, Flow, analytics sync
- **Dashboard & Forms** — Partner self-service (customizable)

## What Changes

As you move toward white-label:

| Moving Right → | You Gain | You Take On |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| Theme Sections | Design control | Section maintenance |
| Custom CSS | Brand expression | CSS management |
| Headless API | Complete UI freedom | Frontend development |
| White-Label | Platform ownership | Full stack responsibility |

## Progressive Customization

You don't have to choose once and forever. Start simple, customize progressively:

1. **Launch with App Blocks** — Get live fast
2. **Add Theme Sections** — For key landing pages
3. **Apply Custom CSS** — Match brand guidelines
4. **Build Custom Features** — Via API as needed
5. **Go Full White-Label** — If business requires

## Practical Funnel Approaches

When building your first creator landing page experience, the spectrum maps to three practical approaches you can use immediately:

| Approach | Spectrum Position | Time to Launch | What You Do |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Pre-Built CC Sections** | App Blocks → Theme Sections | 30–60 minutes | Select 2–4 CC sections, create a `creator.json` template, configure in theme editor |
| **Subtle Theme Modifications** | Theme Sections → Custom CSS | 1–2 hours | Duplicate your homepage template, add dynamic text tokens and discount displays |
| **Experimental Bespoke** | Custom CSS → Headless | 2–4 hours | Transform 2–3 existing sections with creator data, build custom sections, or mix CC + custom |

### When to Use Each

**Pre-Built CC Sections** — You want to get live today. You're testing the concept or launching a campaign fast. You'll customize later.

**Subtle Theme Modifications** — You already have a strong brand and homepage. You want creator co-branding to feel like a natural extension, not a separate experience.

**Experimental Bespoke** — You have a specific creative vision or want to differentiate your creator experience from competitors. You're willing to invest more time for a unique result.

<Tip>
**Recommendation:** Start with Pre-Built CC Sections to prove the concept. Once you see conversion data, move toward Subtle Modifications or Bespoke based on what your brand needs.
