## Why Co-branded Emails Matter

When a customer comes through a partner's funnel, every touchpoint should reinforce that relationship. Generic emails break the spell.

**Co-branded emails:**
- Maintain partner context throughout the journey
- Increase open rates with personalization
- Drive higher click-through with relevance
- Build trust through consistency
- Encourage repeat purchases through partner relationship

## Setting Up Co-branded Flows

### Data Requirements

To personalize emails with partner context, you need:

| Data Point | Source | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Partner name | Cart attributes | Email copy personalization |
| Partner photo | Metaobject | Visual personalization |
| Discount code | Cart attributes | Continued discount access |
| Partner handle | Cart attributes | Link back to storefront |

### Passing Partner Data

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cart Attributes">
    Store partner info in cart, which flows to order:
    
    ```liquid
    {% assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle'] %}
    {% assign cc_name = cart.attributes['cc-creator-name'] %}
    {% assign cc_code = cart.attributes['cc-discount-code'] %}
    ```
    
    These persist to the order and are available in email platforms.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Order Properties">
    Access in Klaviyo/email platforms:
    
    ```
    {{ event.extra.cc-creator-handle }}
    {{ event.extra.cc-creator-name }}
    {{ event.extra.cc-discount-code }}
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Customer Properties">
    Sync partner data to customer profile:
    
    ```
    cc_acquired_by: "partner-handle"
    cc_first_partner: "partner-name"
    cc_discount_code: "PARTNER15"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Klaviyo Implementation

### Flow Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Partner-Aware Flow">
    Clone your existing flow (e.g., cart abandonment) and add partner logic.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Conditional Split">
    Split based on whether partner context exists:
    
    ```
    IF {{ event.extra.cc-creator-handle }} IS SET
    → Partner branch (co-branded emails)
    ELSE
    → Standard branch (regular emails)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Partner Email Variant">
    Design email with partner personalization (see below).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with Partner Traffic">
    Send test orders through partner funnels to verify personalization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Email Template Structure

```html
<!-- Partner header section -->
{% if event.extra.cc-creator-name %}
<div class="partner-header">
  <img src="{{ event.extra.cc-creator-photo }}" alt="{{ event.extra.cc-creator-name }}" />
  <p>Recommended by {{ event.extra.cc-creator-name }}</p>
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- Email content -->
<h1>Your cart is waiting!</h1>
<p>The items {{ event.extra.cc-creator-name }} picked for you are still available.</p>

<!-- Discount reminder -->
{% if event.extra.cc-discount-code %}
<div class="discount-box">
  <p>Use code <strong>{{ event.extra.cc-discount-code }}</strong> for your discount!</p>
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- CTA back to partner page -->
<a href="https://yourstore.com/pages/creators/{{ event.extra.cc-creator-handle }}">
  Return to {{ event.extra.cc-creator-name }}'s Page
</a>
```
