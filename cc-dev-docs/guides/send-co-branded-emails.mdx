## Why Co-branded Emails Matter

When a customer comes through a partner's funnel, every touchpoint should reinforce that relationship. Generic emails break the spell.

**Co-branded emails:**
- Maintain partner context throughout the journey
- Increase open rates with personalization
- Drive higher click-through with relevance
- Build trust through consistency
- Encourage repeat purchases through partner relationship

## Setting Up Co-branded Flows

### Data Requirements

To personalize emails with partner context, you need:

| Data Point | Source | Use |
|------------|--------|-----|
| Partner name | Cart attributes | Email copy personalization |
| Partner photo | Metaobject | Visual personalization |
| Discount code | Cart attributes | Continued discount access |
| Partner handle | Cart attributes | Link back to storefront |

### Passing Partner Data

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Flow Templates">
    Use Shopify Flow templates to send events into Klaviyo:
    - `CC // Log a customer abandoned cart Klaviyo event`
    - `CC // Log a custom post-purchase Klaviyo event`
    - `CC // Log a customer marketing opt-in Klaviyo event`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Event Properties">
    In each Klaviyo `Track an Event` action, map:

    ```
    Event Properties: {{getMetaobjectEntry.data}}
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Customer Properties">
    Include creator/collab context in `Customer Properties`, for example:

    ```
    cc-creator-first-name
    cc-creator-profile-picture
    cc-creator-shop-handle
    cc-collab-discount-code
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Klaviyo Implementation

### Flow Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use CreatorCommerce B2C event names as Klaviyo triggers">
    Build flows from:
    - `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
    - `Creator Attributed Order`
    - `Marketing Opt In From Creator`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Conditional Split">
    Split based on whether partner context exists:
    
    ```
    IF person|lookup:'cc-creator-shop-handle' IS SET
    → Partner branch (co-branded emails)
    ELSE
    → Standard branch (regular emails)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Partner Email Variant">
    Design email with partner personalization (see below).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with Partner Traffic">
    Send test orders through partner funnels to verify personalization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Email Template Structure

```html
<!-- Partner header section -->
{% if person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' %}
<div class="partner-header">
  <img src="{{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-profile-picture' }}" alt="{{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' }}" />
  <p>Recommended by {{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' }}</p>
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- Email content -->
<h1>Your cart is waiting!</h1>
<p>The items {{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' }} picked for you are still available.</p>

<!-- Discount reminder -->
{% if person|lookup:'cc-collab-discount-code' %}
<div class="discount-box">
  <p>Use code <strong>{{ person|lookup:'cc-collab-discount-code' }}</strong> for your discount!</p>
</div>
{% endif %}

<!-- CTA back to partner page -->
<a href="https://yourstore.com/pages/creators/{{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-shop-handle' }}">
  Return to {{ person|lookup:'cc-creator-first-name' }}'s Page
</a>
```
