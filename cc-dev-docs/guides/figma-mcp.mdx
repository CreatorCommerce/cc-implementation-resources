# Figma MCP Setup

Connect your AI assistant to Figma using the Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Overview

The Figma MCP server enables your AI assistant to interact with Figma designs, retrieve design tokens, generate code from designs, and work with Figma files programmatically. This is useful when designing CreatorCommerce interfaces and dashboards.
