## What It Is

When customers arrive from a creator's link, product pages display creator context—their photo, a product quote, and the discounted price they'll receive at checkout.

## Key Capabilities

- **Creator quote badges** — "Why I love this" testimonials on products
- **Discounted price display** — Show savings before checkout
- **Creator attribution** — Small creator callout on any PDP
- **UGC integration** — Creator content/photos on product pages
- **Persistent context** — Creator info follows through browsing

## Pre-Built Sections

CreatorCommerce includes two complementary product page sections:

### CC Product - Quote Badge

A sticky banner that appears when a creator has a note or media for the product:

- Shows creator avatar with elegant light reflection effects
- Displays product quote/note
- Shows UGC attached to product
- Expandable to reveal full quote and media carousel
- Multiple positioning options (fixed top, fixed bottom, natural)

**Best for:** Prominent, always-visible creator endorsement

### CC Product - Quote Editorial

An editorial-style quote display:

- Shows the same quote as the badge
- More editorial, magazine-style presentation
- Shows creator image
- Different visual treatment from the badge

**Best for:** Editorial, story-driven product pages

**Recommendation:** Use **both** sections together. They show the same quote but in different formats—the badge is a sticky banner, the editorial is more integrated into the page flow.

## How It Works

```liquid
{% if cc_creator %}
  <div class="cc-product-endorsement">
    <img src="{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture | image_url: width: 60 }}" />
    <blockquote>
      {{ product_quote | default: "One of my favorites!" }}
      <cite>— {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}</cite>
    </blockquote>
  </div>
  
  <div class="cc-price">
    <span class="original">{{ product.price | money }}</span>
    <span class="discounted">{{ discounted_price | money }}</span>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Product recommendations | Quote badge + discounted price |
| Expert endorsements | Credential display + detailed review |
| UGC showcase | Creator photo using product |
| Bundle recommendations | Multi-product creator picks |

## How This Connects

- PDP personalization depends on creator context established earlier in the session (landing pages, directories, paid/affiliate link entry points).
- Product-level quote/media enhancements usually originate from creator data capture workflows in [Whitelabel Forms & Dashboards](/guides/features/whitelabel-forms-dashboards).
- PDP interaction feeds directly into [Co-branded Carts & Checkout](/guides/features/co-branded-carts-checkout), where attribution and discount persistence are enforced.
