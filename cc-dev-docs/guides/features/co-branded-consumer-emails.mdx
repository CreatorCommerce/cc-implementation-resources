title: 'Co-branded Consumer Emails'
description: 'Customer-facing emails that include creator context—abandoned cart, post-purchase, and win-back with personalization.'

## What It Is

When a customer shops in creator context, customer-facing lifecycle emails stay co-branded with that creator (name, image, shop context, and discount context). This preserves trust from click to purchase and retention.

## Key Capabilities

- **Cart abandonment** — "Don't forget [Creator]'s picks"
- **Post-purchase** — "Thanks for shopping with [Creator]"
- **Win-back** — "[Creator] has new recommendations"
- **Browse abandonment** — Products they viewed + creator discount
- **Review requests** — Attribute review to creator referral

<Info>
This page is about **consumer-facing** messaging only (B2C).  
Creator/affiliate lifecycle communication (B2B) is documented separately in [Collab Messaging Integrations](/guides/features/collab-messaging-integrations).

## How Consumer Flows Are Powered

Consumer co-branded email flows are powered by Shopify Flow templates that push events to Klaviyo only when creator context is present.

| Template | Event Name Sent to Klaviyo | Primary Trigger |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| `CC // Log a customer abandoned cart Klaviyo event` | `Creator Checkout Abandoned` | Customer abandons checkout |
| `CC // Log a custom post-purchase Klaviyo event` | `Creator Attributed Order` | Order created |
| `CC // Log a customer marketing opt-in Klaviyo event` | `Marketing Opt In From Creator` | Customer marketing opt-in/subscribe event |

Each template follows the same pattern:
1. Trigger
2. Confirm creator-context condition
3. `Get metaobject entry`
4. Klaviyo `Track an Event` action with CC payload

## Email Personalization

| Email Type | Creator Elements |
|------------|------------------|
| Cart abandonment | Photo, name, discount reminder |
| Order confirmation | "You shopped with [Creator]" banner |
| Shipping notification | Creator thank-you message |
| Review request | "Tell [Creator] what you think" |
| Win-back | "[Creator] misses you" + new picks |

## Dynamic Content Block

```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <div class="creator-block">
    <img src="{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-profile-picture" }}" />
    <p>You're shopping with <strong>{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }}</strong></p>
    <p>Use code {{ person|lookup:"cc-collab-discount-code" }} for {{ person|lookup:"cc-collab-discount-amount" }}% off</p>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

<Info>
In Klaviyo templates use:
- Profile properties: `{{ person|lookup:"field-name" }}`
- Event properties: `{{ event.property_name }}`
- Nested event properties: `{{ event.property.nested_variable }}`
</Info>

## Payload Shape Used in Klaviyo Track Event

The Shopify Flow templates map:

- `Event Properties` -> `{{getMetaobjectEntry.data}}`
- `Customer Properties` -> a creator/collab object including fields such as:
  - `cc-creator-first-name`
  - `cc-creator-last-name`
  - `cc-creator-profile-picture`
  - `cc-creator-shop-title`
  - `cc-creator-shop-theme-primary-color`
  - `cc-creator-shop-handle`
  - `cc-collab-affiliate-link`
  - `cc-collab-discount-amount`
  - `cc-collab-discount-code`
  - `cc-collab-affiliate-code`
  - `cc-collab-discount-type`
  - `cc-creator-shop-description`

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|
| Open rate | +15-25% |
| Click rate | +20-35% |
| Conversion | +30-50% |
| Unsubscribe | -10-20% |

## How This Connects

- Co-branded consumer emails begin with storefront visits where creator context is captured (landing, PDP, popup, cart).
- When email is collected, persist creator association so the profile carries both shopper identity and referring creator context.
- In most implementations, this is powered by [Klaviyo](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo) using Shopify Flow templates and CC payload mapping described in [Klaviyo Events](/references/webhooks-klaviyo).
- This is the B2C side of messaging and complements partner lifecycle messaging in [Collab Messaging Integrations](/guides/features/collab-messaging-integrations).
