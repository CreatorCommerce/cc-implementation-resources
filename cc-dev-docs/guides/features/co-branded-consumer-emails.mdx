## What It Is

When a customer shops through a creator's page, their subsequent emails include that creator's branding—photo, name, and discount code. This reinforces the relationship and improves engagement.

## Key Capabilities

- **Cart abandonment** — "Don't forget [Creator]'s picks"
- **Post-purchase** — "Thanks for shopping with [Creator]"
- **Win-back** — "[Creator] has new recommendations"
- **Browse abandonment** — Products they viewed + creator discount
- **Review requests** — Attribute review to creator referral

## Email Personalization

| Email Type | Creator Elements |
|------------|------------------|
| Cart abandonment | Photo, name, discount reminder |
| Order confirmation | "You shopped with [Creator]" banner |
| Shipping notification | Creator thank-you message |
| Review request | "Tell [Creator] what you think" |
| Win-back | "[Creator] misses you" + new picks |

## Dynamic Content Block

```html
{% if person.cc_creator_name %}
  <div class="creator-block">
    <img src="{{ person.cc_creator_image }}" />
    <p>You're shopping with <strong>{{ person.cc_creator_name }}</strong></p>
    <p>Use code {{ person.cc_discount_code }} for {{ person.cc_discount_amount }}% off</p>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```
