## What It Is

Give partners branded experiences—from the application form they fill out to the dashboard where they manage their page. Full CSS customization and optional custom builds.

## Key Capabilities

- **Custom application forms** — Collect the data you need
- **Branded dashboards** — Your colors, logo, domain
- **CSS injection** — Override any dashboard styles
- **Custom domains** — `partners.yourbrand.com`
- **Role-based access** — Different views by tier

## Dashboard Customization

### Styles Override URL

The **Styles Override URL** setting (found in Settings → Store Information) allows you to completely take over the UI of CreatorCommerce-hosted forms and dashboards by linking to a custom CSS file.

**How to set it up:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your CSS file">
    Generate a stylesheet with your brand fonts, colors, and styling. You can use ChatGPT, Claude, or your existing brand CSS as a base. See the [CSS Reference](/references/css-reference) for available selectors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload to Shopify">
    In Shopify Admin → **Content → Files**, click **Upload file** and select your CSS file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the file URL">
    Once uploaded, click the file to copy its URL (e.g., `https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/xxxxx/xxxxx/your-styles.css`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste into CreatorCommerce">
    Go to CreatorCommerce → **Settings → Store Information → Styles Override URL** and paste the URL.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use cases:**
- Hide the "Powered by CreatorCommerce" banner
- Change border radius, colors, fonts to match your brand
- Customize form layouts and dashboard appearance
- Match your exact brand guidelines

**Best practices:**
- Keep CSS file under 100KB
- Use version query parameters: `styles.css?v=2025-01-15`
- Test across mobile and desktop
- Don't hide required form fields or break functionality

### CSS Injection Example

```css
/* Injected via Styles Override URL */
:root {
  --cc-primary-color: #FF4438;
  --cc-font-family: 'Your Brand Font', sans-serif;
}

.cc-dashboard-header {
  background: var(--cc-primary-color);
}

.cc-logo {
  content: url('https://yourbrand.com/logo.svg');
}
```

## Form Customization

| Field Type | Options |
|------------|---------|
| Text | Required, validation, placeholder |
| Dropdown | Static or dynamic options |
| File upload | Image, video, document |
| Multi-select | Products, categories |
| Conditional | Show/hide based on answers |

### Built-in Form Types

CreatorCommerce includes four native form types that cover most data collection needs:

| Form Type | Purpose | Data Level |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Onboarding** | Collect identity, preferences, and activation data at signup | Collab-level [custom fields](/references/custom-fields-reference) |
| **Collection** | Gather drop-level data when creators curate product lists | Drop-level custom fields |
| **Product** | Collect product-level notes, testimonials within drops | Product-level custom fields |
| **Custom** | Ongoing or campaign-specific data collection | Any level |

Each form type maps collected data to [custom fields](/references/custom-fields-reference) that are automatically stored in the creator metaobject and available in Liquid templates on the storefront.

## Dashboard Sections

- **Home** — Performance overview, quick stats
- **My Page** — Edit bio, photo, social links
- **Products** — Manage drops and product picks
- **Content** — Upload UGC, testimonials
- **Earnings** — Commission tracking, payouts
- **Settings** — Account, notifications

## How This Connects

- Forms and dashboards are a foundational data source for co-branded storefront personalization.
- Data captured here populates creator/collab fields consumed by landing pages, product lists, PDP quote sections, popups, and messaging.
- When combined with [Recruitment Integrations](/guides/features/recruitment-integrations), this creates a complete pipeline: import baseline creator records, then enrich with brand-specific profile/content data.
