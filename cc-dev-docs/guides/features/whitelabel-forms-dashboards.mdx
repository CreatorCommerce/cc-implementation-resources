## What It Is

Give partners branded experiences—from the application form they fill out to the dashboard where they manage their page. Full CSS customization and optional custom builds.

## Key Capabilities

- **Custom application forms** — Collect the data you need
- **Branded dashboards** — Your colors, logo, domain
- **CSS injection** — Override any dashboard styles
- **Custom domains** — `partners.yourbrand.com`
- **Role-based access** — Different views by tier

## Dashboard Customization

```css
/* Injected via CC admin */
:root {
  --cc-primary-color: #FF4438;
  --cc-font-family: 'Your Brand Font', sans-serif;
}

.cc-dashboard-header {
  background: var(--cc-primary-color);
}

.cc-logo {
  content: url('https://yourbrand.com/logo.svg');
}
```

## Form Customization

| Field Type | Options |
|------------|---------|
| Text | Required, validation, placeholder |
| Dropdown | Static or dynamic options |
| File upload | Image, video, document |
| Multi-select | Products, categories |
| Conditional | Show/hide based on answers |

### Built-in Form Types

CreatorCommerce includes four native form types that cover most data collection needs:

| Form Type | Purpose | Data Level |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Onboarding** | Collect identity, preferences, and activation data at signup | Collab-level [custom fields](/references/custom-fields-reference) |
| **Collection** | Gather drop-level data when creators curate product lists | Drop-level custom fields |
| **Product** | Collect product-level notes, testimonials within drops | Product-level custom fields |
| **Custom** | Ongoing or campaign-specific data collection | Any level |

Each form type maps collected data to [custom fields](/references/custom-fields-reference) that are automatically stored in the creator metaobject and available in Liquid templates on the storefront.
