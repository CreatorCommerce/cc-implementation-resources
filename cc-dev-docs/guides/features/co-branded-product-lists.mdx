## What It Is

Drops are creator-curated product collections. Each creator can have multiple drops (e.g., "Summer Favorites", "Daily Essentials"), and these display as branded product lists on their pages.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multiple drops per creator** — Organize products into themed collections
- **Custom product ordering** — Creator controls display order
- **Featured media** — Hero image/video per drop
- **Drop-level quotes** — Creator description for each collection
- **Quick add-to-cart** — Streamlined purchase flow

## Pre-Built Sections

CreatorCommerce offers two product section types:

### CC Products - Curated Lists

**Best for:** Higher SKU stores (10+ products)

- Great for apparel and health & beauty
- Creators can make multiple collections (drops)
- Dropdown selector to switch between drops
- "Add Bundle to Cart" functionality
- Pre-built product card included (or use your theme's card)

**When to use:** Stores with many products where creators curate multiple themed collections

### CC Products - Curated Bundle

**Best for:** Lower SKU stores (< 10 products)

- Showcases bundles of products
- Simpler, focused display
- Great for smaller catalogs

**When to use:** Stores with fewer products where creators recommend complete bundles

## How It Works

```liquid
{% assign drops = cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-drops %}

{% for drop in drops %}
  <section class="cc-drop">
    <h2>{{ drop['cc-creator-drop-name'] }}</h2>
    <p>{{ drop['cc-creator-drop-description'] }}</p>
    
    <div class="cc-products-grid">
      {% for product_data in drop['cc-creator-drop-products'] %}
        {% assign product_id = product_data['cc-creator-drop-product-shopify-id'] %}
        {% comment %} Render product card {% endcomment %}
      {% endfor %}
    </div>
  </section>
{% endfor %}
```

## Drop Data Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cc-creator-drop-name` | Display name for the collection |
| `cc-creator-drop-description` | Creator's description |
| `cc-creator-drop-collection-id` | Linked Shopify collection |
| `cc-creator-drop-products` | Array of product references |
| `cc-creator-drop-featured-media` | Hero image/video URL |

## How This Connects

- Product lists are downstream of landing-page creator context and rely on `cc_creator` being resolved correctly.
- Drop and enhancement fields are populated through creator workflows in [Whitelabel Forms & Dashboards](/guides/features/whitelabel-forms-dashboards) and/or external sync in [Recruitment Integrations](/guides/features/recruitment-integrations).
- Product-list interactions (`add to cart`, bundle actions) hand off directly to [Co-branded Carts & Checkout](/guides/features/co-branded-carts-checkout) and [Shopify-native Attribution](/guides/features/shopify-native-attribution).
