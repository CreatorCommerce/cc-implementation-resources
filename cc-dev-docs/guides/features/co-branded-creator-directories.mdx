## What Is a Creator Directory?

A creator directory is a storefront page (or section) where shoppers can browse all the creators, ambassadors, practitioners, or partners associated with your brand. Unlike a landing page that focuses on a single creator, a directory presents your entire creator network as a discoverable experience.

**Why it matters:**
- Shoppers can find creators they already follow
- New shoppers discover creators relevant to their interests
- Builds brand credibility through social proof at scale
- Drives traffic to individual creator pages

## Types of Directories

### Full Network Directory

**What:** A dedicated page showing all public creators in a browsable grid.

**Best for:**
- Brands with 10+ active creators
- Stores where creator discovery is a key part of the shopping journey
- Building trust — "look how many experts recommend us"

**Shopper experience:** Browse a grid of creator cards with photos, names, and short bios. Click any card to visit that creator's dedicated landing page.

### Category-Filtered Directory

**What:** A directory with built-in filtering by category, specialty, location, or tier.

**Best for:**
- Brands with diverse creator types (e.g., fitness trainers vs. nutritionists vs. wellness coaches)
- Stores with regional creators where geography matters
- Enterprise programs with tiered partnerships

**Shopper experience:** Choose a filter (e.g., "Yoga" or "New York") to narrow down the creator grid. Useful when your creator base is large enough that browsing all at once would be overwhelming.

### Similar Creators

**What:** A section (usually on a creator's landing page) showing creators who share an attribute — same tier, category, location, etc.

**Best for:**
- Cross-pollination between similar creator audiences
- Keeping shoppers exploring after they've viewed one creator's page
- Encouraging discovery of lesser-known creators alongside popular ones

**Shopper experience:** "If you like Sarah, you might also like..." — a row of related creator cards at the bottom of a landing page.

### Featured / Curated Spotlight

**What:** A small, hand-picked selection of featured creators displayed on your homepage, collection pages, or other high-traffic areas.

**Best for:**
- Highlighting new creators or seasonal partnerships
- Homepage social proof without a full directory
- Campaigns promoting specific creator segments

**Shopper experience:** A compact row or banner of 3–6 featured creators, often with a "View All" link to the full directory.

## Choosing the Right Directory Type

| Your Situation | Recommended Type |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 10–30 creators, simple program | Full Network Directory |
| 30+ creators, diverse categories | Category-Filtered Directory |
| Already have landing pages, want cross-discovery | Similar Creators section |
| Homepage social proof, small program | Featured / Curated Spotlight |
| Enterprise with tiers + regions | Category-Filtered + Similar Creators |

<Tip>
**Start with the Full Network Directory.** It's the simplest to build and works for any program size. You can layer on filtering and "similar creators" as your program grows.

## Key Capabilities

### What You Can Display

- **Creator profile photo** — or initials fallback if no photo
- **Creator name** — first name, full name, or display name
- **Short bio / description** — truncated for card view
- **Creator category / specialty** — from custom fields
- **Creator location** — if geography is relevant
- **Drops count** — number of curated product lists
- **Discount availability** — indicator that a code exists

### Filtering Options

- By **category** (e.g., "fitness", "beauty", "nutrition")
- By **tier** (e.g., "ambassador", "affiliate", "VIP")
- By **location** (e.g., "New York", "London")
- By **custom fields** (any field stored in the creator metaobject)

### Performance Guardrails

- Configure maximum creators displayed per page
- Option to require profile pictures (hide incomplete profiles)
- Exclude the currently active creator from directory sections

## What It Looks Like in Practice

**Wellness brand (30 practitioners):**

Category-filtered directory with tabs for "Style", "Fitness", "Lifestyle". Each tab shows a filtered grid. Homepage features a "Featured Creators" spotlight with 4 hand-picked influencers.

**Supplement brand (15 athletes):**
Full directory on homepage as a social proof section. Each athlete's landing page includes a "Similar Athletes" section showing others in the same sport category.
