## How This Connects

- Collab messaging is primarily powered by the [Klaviyo](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo) integration and CC creator/collab activity sync.
- The same core creator/collab records that power storefront personalization also power partner messaging events and profile updates.
- As creator state changes (shop handle, affiliate code, activation, performance), CC pushes updated values so flows stay accurate.
- This partner-facing stream should be operated alongside [Co-branded Consumer Emails](/guides/features/co-branded-consumer-emails), not as a replacement.
