## What It Is

Pop-ups that recognize creator context and display personalized messaging—welcome offers, exit intent, email capture—all tied to the creator who referred the customer.

## Key Capabilities

- **Creator-aware triggers** — Show different pop-ups based on referral source
- **Personalized messaging** — Include creator name and discount
- **Email capture with attribution** — Sign-ups tagged to creator
- **Exit intent** — Remind leaving visitors of their exclusive discount
- **Suppression logic** — Hide generic pop-ups for CC traffic

## How It Works

```liquid
{% if cc_creator %}
  <div class="cc-popup" id="cc-welcome-popup">
    <img src="{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture | image_url: width: 80 }}" />
    <h3>Welcome! {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }} sent you</h3>
    <p>Enjoy {{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount }}% off with code:</p>
    <strong>{{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-code }}</strong>
    <button onclick="copyDiscount()">Copy Code</button>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

```javascript
// Suppress generic pop-ups for CC traffic
if (localStorage.getItem('cc_creator_handle')) {
  window.POPUP_SUPPRESSED = true;
}
```

## Pop-up Types

| Type | Trigger | Content |
|------|---------|---------|
| Welcome | Page load (first visit) | Creator intro + discount |
| Exit intent | Mouse leaves viewport | Don't forget your code! |
| Email capture | Scroll depth / time | Join + get creator's picks |
| Cart reminder | Idle on cart page | Creator says checkout now |

## How This Connects

- Popups read the same creator context used by landing and product pages, so they should only render after `cc_creator` is available.
- Captured emails should keep creator association (handle/code/source page) so downstream [Co-branded Consumer Emails](/guides/features/co-branded-consumer-emails) can stay personalized.
- For most stacks, that association is synced to Klaviyo via [Klaviyo](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo), where creator-attributed segments and flows are built.
