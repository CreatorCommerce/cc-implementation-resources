## What It Is

Every creator gets a unique landing page on your Shopify store that showcases their personal brand alongside yours. These pages are the entry point for co-branded shopping experiences.

## Key Capabilities

- **Dynamic creator content** — Name, photo, bio, social links
- **Curated product displays** — Creator's handpicked "drops"
- **Discount callouts** — Prominent code and savings display
- **Brand-matched theming** — Creator colors within your design system
- **Full Liquid control** — Build any layout with standard Shopify templating

## How It Works

```liquid
{% assign cc_creator = metaobject %}

<section class="creator-hero">
  <img src="{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture | image_url: width: 400 }}" />
  <h1>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Picks</h1>
  <p>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-description }}</p>
  <span class="discount">{{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount }}% OFF with {{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-code }}</span>
</section>
```
