## What It Is

Don't wait for creators to fill out every field. Content automation uses AI and rules to generate page content from order history, social profiles, and partial data.

## Key Capabilities

- **Bio generation** — AI writes bios from social profiles
- **Product recommendations** — Auto-suggest based on history
- **Image optimization** — Resize, crop, enhance uploads
- **Content moderation** — Auto-approve or flag for review
- **Bulk enrichment** — Process all partners at once

## Automation Types

| Input | Output | Method |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Instagram handle | Bio text | AI generation |
| Order history | Product picks | Algorithm |
| Profile photo | Cropped avatar | Image processing |
