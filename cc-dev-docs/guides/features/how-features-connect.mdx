description: 'A system-level map of how CreatorCommerce features connect across data capture, storefront personalization, attribution, messaging, and automation.'

## Why This Matters

CreatorCommerce is not a collection of isolated features. It is a connected Shopify-native system where creator and collab data is collected once, then reused across storefront UI, cart/checkout attribution, messaging, and downstream automation.

## System Flow

```text
Recruitment + Forms + Integrations
        ↓
Creator + Collab data written to Shopify/CC model
        ↓
Storefront resolves cc_creator and renders co-branded UI
        ↓
Cart attributes + web pixel preserve attribution context
        ↓
Orders + customers tagged in Shopify + reflected in CC dashboard
        ↓
Klaviyo + Shopify Flow + API workflows activate messaging and automation
```
