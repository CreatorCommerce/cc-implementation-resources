## What It Is

Sync partners from your existing recruitment tools into CreatorCommerce. When a creator signs up through your affiliate platform or CRM, they're automatically set up with a co-branded page.

## Key Capabilities

- **Affiliate platform sync** — Impact, ShareASale, Refersion, etc.
- **CRM integration** — HubSpot, Salesforce, Attentive
- **Influencer platforms** — Grin, CreatorIQ, Aspire
- **Custom webhooks** — Any system that can POST data
- **Bi-directional sync** — Data flows both ways

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Sync Type | Features |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Impact | API | Partners, commissions, codes |
| Refersion | Webhook | Partners, orders |
| Grin | API | Creators, campaigns |
| HubSpot | API | Contacts, deals |
| Klaviyo | Events | Profiles, segments |
| Custom | Webhook | Any data structure |

## Sync Flow

```
Affiliate Platform → Webhook/API → CreatorCommerce

        ↓                                ↓
   Discount Code ←←←←←←←←←← Synced Back
```

## Data Mapped

| Source Field | CC Field |
|--------------|----------|
| Email | Creator email |
| Name | First/last name |
| Promo code | Discount code |
| Commission rate | Collab commission |
| Tier/status | Partner tier |

## How This Connects

- Recruitment integrations are a primary upstream source of creator/collab data used across the whole platform.
- Synced fields (identity, handle, tier, discount, affiliate link) become inputs for landing pages, product lists, cart messaging, attribution, and Klaviyo flows.
- Pair recruitment sync with [Whitelabel Forms & Dashboards](/guides/features/whitelabel-forms-dashboards) when you need creators to complete richer profile or content fields after initial import.
