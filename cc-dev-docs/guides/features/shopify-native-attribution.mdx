description: 'Track orders back to creators using native Shopify objects—discount codes, order tags, cart attributes, and metafields.'

## What It Is

CreatorCommerce attribution lives entirely within Shopify's data model. Orders are tracked via discount codes, cart attributes, and tags—no external tracking required.

## Key Capabilities

- **Discount code matching** — Each creator has a unique code
- **Cart attribute storage** — Creator handle persisted in cart
- **Order tagging** — Attributed orders tagged automatically
- **Customer tagging** — Customers tagged by referral source
- **Metafield storage** — Extended data on orders/customers

## Attribution Methods

| Method | How It Works | Reliability |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Discount code | Unique code per creator | ⭐⭐⭐ Highest |
| Cart attributes | Creator handle in cart | ⭐⭐ High |
| UTM parameters | `?ref=creator-handle` | ⭐ Good |
| Cookie/localStorage | Session persistence | ⭐ Backup |

## Order Tags Applied

```
cc-attributed
cc-creator:sarah-jones
cc-discount:SARAH15
cc-tier:gold
```

## Customer Tags Applied

```
cc-referred
cc-first-creator:sarah-jones
cc-lifetime-orders:3
```

## Shopify Flow Integration

Trigger workflows on attributed orders:

```yaml
trigger: order_created
condition: order.tags contains "cc-attributed"
actions:
  - Calculate commission
  - Notify creator
  - Update partner metrics
```

## How This Connects

- Attribution quality comes from combining cart attributes, discount usage, and the [CC Web Pixel](/guides/dev/enable-cc-web-pixel), not from a single signal.
- CC writes attribution into native Shopify constructs (tags, attributes, metafields), which can be used directly in admin reporting and [Shopify Flow](/guides/dev/implement-shopify-flow).
- The same attribution context is visible in CC reporting surfaces and underpins co-branded lifecycle messaging.
- If you need custom reporting outputs or bespoke payloads/endpoints for BI pipelines, contact CreatorCommerce for custom reporting API access.
