title: 'Initial Settings Configuration'
description: 'Configure your CreatorCommerce instance with brand kit values, creator settings, onboarding configuration, discount protection, and tracking preferences.'
---

<Info>
**First time setup?** Complete these settings before creating your first collabs. These configurations establish defaults that apply across all creator partnerships and co-branded experiences.
</Info>

## Overview

Initial settings are organized into four main categories:

1. **Store Information** — Brand kit values (name, colors, logo, cover image, CSS overrides)
2. **Creator Settings** — Shop creation, messaging, product visibility
3. **Onboarding Settings** — Splash screen content and form configuration
4. **Discount Settings** — Safe discount code protection and templates
5. **Tracking** — Web pixel configuration

---

## Store Information (Brand Kit)

Brand kit values set the default visual identity for all creators and appear across forms, dashboards, and co-branded storefronts.

### Brand Display Name

**Location:** Settings → Store Information → Name

**What it does:**
- Displays generically on all CreatorCommerce forms
- Appears anywhere your brand name displays for a creator
- Sets the default brand name that pulls through into pre-built CreatorCommerce templates
- Stored in your CreatorCommerce metaobject data

**Example:** "Acme Fitness" appears on creator onboarding forms and co-branded landing pages.

### Primary Color

**Location:** Settings → Store Information → Primary Color

**What it does:**
- Sets the default primary color (hex) for all creators
- If a creator has previously set a color in any CreatorCommerce instance, their favorite color is intelligently brought over
- If a creator has never set a color, defaults to your brand's primary color
- Creators can change this if you allow them to customize

**Use cases:**
- Co-branded storefront theming
- Creator dashboard branding
- Form styling
- Email templates

**Related:**

- [CSS Styling of CC Pages](/references/css-reference) — Override colors with custom CSS

### Primary Logo

**Location:** Settings → Store Information → Primary Logo

**What it does:**
- Sets the default logo for creator experiences
- Used in co-branded templates and creator dashboards
- Appears on forms and onboarding screens

**Best practices:**
- Use a logo mark with square dimensions (or at least even width × height)
- Recommended: 400×400px minimum
- Formats: PNG, SVG, or JPG
- Transparent background preferred

**Related:**

- [Whitelabel Forms & Dashboards](/guides/features/whitelabel-forms-dashboards) — Logo in creator dashboards

### Cover Image

**Location:** Settings → Store Information → Cover Image

**What it does:**
- Used on custom forms and onboarding screens
- Can be an image or video
- Will be cropped to fit display areas

**Best practices:**
- Use high-quality imagery that represents your brand
- Consider video for more engaging onboarding experiences
- Recommended dimensions: 1920×1080px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- File size: Keep under 5MB for optimal loading

- [Custom Forms](/guides/creator-experience/forms/custom/overview) — Cover image in form templates

### Styles Override URL

**Location:** Settings → Store Information → Styles Override URL

**What it does:**
- Allows you to paste a link to a CSS stylesheet
- Completely takes over the UI of CreatorCommerce-hosted forms and dashboards
- Enables full visual customization without modifying core functionality

**Use cases:**
- Hide the "Powered by CreatorCommerce" banner
- Change border radius, colors, fonts
- Match your exact brand guidelines
- Customize form layouts and dashboard appearance

**How to set up:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your CSS file">
    Generate a stylesheet with your brand fonts, colors, and styling preferences. You can use:
    - ChatGPT or Claude to generate a complete stylesheet
    - Your existing brand CSS as a base
    - The [CSS Reference](/references/css-reference) for available selectors
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload to Shopify">
    In Shopify Admin:
    1. Go to **Content → Files**
    2. Click **Upload file**
    3. Select your CSS file
    4. Wait for upload to complete
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the file URL">
    Once uploaded, click the file in your Files list to copy its URL. It will look like:
    ```
    https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/xxxxx/xxxxx/your-styles.css
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste into CreatorCommerce">
    Go back to CreatorCommerce → Settings → Store Information → Styles Override URL
    Paste the URL and save.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Best practices:**
- Keep CSS file under 100KB
- Use version query parameters for cache busting: `styles.css?v=2025-01-15`
- Test across mobile and desktop
- Don't hide required form fields or break functionality

## Creator Settings

Configure how creator shops are created, what products they can see, and how they're communicated with.

### Automatically Create Shops for New Clubs

**Location:** Settings → Creator Settings → Automatically Create Shops

**Recommended:** ✅ Enabled

**What it does:**
- **Enabled:** Shop is created automatically with default data when a new collab is established. Creators can go through onboarding to add extra data, but the shop exists immediately.
- **Disabled:** Creators must explicitly create their shops by going through the onboarding form. Shop won't exist until onboarding is completed.

**When to disable:**
- You want to gate shop creation behind a specific onboarding flow
- You need creators to complete certain steps before their shop is accessible
- You're running a curated program where not all creators get shops immediately

**Related:**
- [Make Your First Collabs](/guides/make-your-first-collabs) — Creating creator partnerships
- [Onboarding Forms](/guides/creator-experience/forms/onboarding/overview) — Shop creation during onboarding

### Enable Default Messaging / Creator Communication

**Location:** Settings → Creator Settings → Enable Default Messaging

**What it does:**
- **Enabled:** CreatorCommerce sends emails on your behalf to notify creators about:
  - Available onboarding forms
  - Form availability notifications
  - System-generated communications
- **Disabled:** You handle all creator communication manually or use Klaviyo flows based on CreatorCommerce events

**When to disable:**
- You have a sophisticated email automation setup in Klaviyo
- You want full control over messaging tone and timing
- You're using custom email templates

**Alternative approach (when disabled):**
Use Klaviyo integration to create flows based on CreatorCommerce events:
- `collab.invited` — Send invitation email
- `collab.approved` — Welcome series
- `onboarding.started` — Onboarding reminders
- `drop.created` — New product notifications

- [Welcome Flows](/guides/creator-experience/messaging/welcome-flows) — Onboarding email sequences

### Show Unavailable Products

**Location:** Settings → Creator Settings → Show Unavailable Products

**Default:** ❌ Disabled

**What it does:**
- **Enabled:** Products that are out of stock or unavailable appear in onboarding flows and product selection
- **Disabled:** Only available products are shown (default behavior)

**When to enable:**
- You want creators to choose products that aren't yet available for sale
- You're doing pre-launch product selection
- You want creators to get a jump on adding products to their drops before they go live

**Use case example:**
A new product line launches in 2 weeks. You enable this setting so creators can curate their drops now, and when products become available, they're already set up.

**Related:**
- [Product Selection](/guides/creator-experience/forms/collection/overview) — How creators choose products
- [Drops & Collections](/guides/features/co-branded-product-lists) — Product curation in drops

### Exclude Products with Tags for Creators

**Location:** Settings → Creator Settings → Exclude Products with Tags

**What it does:**
- Allows you to tag products in Shopify that creators should not be able to select
- Enter tag names separated by commas
- Tagged products are hidden from creator product selection flows

**Example:**
If you enter `wholesale,internal-use,test-product`, any product with those tags won't appear in creator onboarding or product selection forms.

**How to use:**
1. In Shopify Admin, tag products you want to exclude
2. In CreatorCommerce Settings, enter the tag names (comma-separated)
3. Tagged products are automatically filtered out

**Related:**
- [Product Selection](/guides/creator-experience/forms/collection/overview) — Product filtering in forms

### Recommended Collection ID

**Location:** Settings → Creator Settings → Recommended Collection ID

**What it does:**
- Showcases a list of recommended products in your forms
- Puts products you want creators to see right in front of them
- Helps guide creators toward specific products or collections

**How to find a Collection ID:**
1. In Shopify Admin, go to **Products → Collections**
2. Click on the collection you want to recommend
3. Look at the URL: `https://admin.shopify.com/store/yourstore/collections/1234567890`
4. The number at the end is the Collection ID

**Use cases:**
- Highlight best-selling products
- Showcase new product launches
- Guide creators to high-margin items
- Feature seasonal collections

## Onboarding Settings

Configure the splash screen and initial messaging creators see when they first access onboarding.

### Onboarding Title

**Location:** Settings → Onboarding Settings → Title

**What it does:**
- Displays on the splash screen of the onboarding page
- First thing creators see when they start onboarding
- Sets the tone for the onboarding experience

**Best practices:**
- Keep it short and welcoming
- Examples: "Welcome to [Brand] Partners", "Join Our Creator Community", "Let's Get Started"

### Onboarding Description

**Location:** Settings → Onboarding Settings → Description

**What it does:**
- Appears below the title on the splash screen
- Provides context about the program and what creators can expect

- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Explain the value proposition
- Set clear expectations

### Onboarding Perks

**Location:** Settings → Onboarding Settings → Perks

- Displays in three slots on the onboarding splash screen
- Separated by commas
- Highlights key benefits of joining your program

**Format:**
Enter three perks separated by commas:
```
Exclusive discounts, Early access to new products, Performance-based commissions
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep each perk concise (3-5 words)
- Focus on creator benefits
- Make them specific and compelling

## Discount Settings

Configure safe discount code protection to keep base discount codes secure while providing unique codes per checkout.

### Enable Safe Discount Codes

**Location:** Settings → Discount Settings → Enable Safe Discount Codes

**What it does:**
- **Enabled:** Creates a unique, safe discount code every time someone clicks a creator link and starts checkout
- **Disabled:** Uses the base discount code directly (exposed to coupon code tools)

**How it works:**
- Base discount code (e.g., `CREATOR20`) remains safe and not exposed
- When a customer clicks a creator link and starts checkout, a cloned discount is created
- The cloned code is unique per checkout session
- Base discount stays protected from coupon code scrapers

**Why use it:**
- Protects your base discount codes from being discovered by coupon tools
- Allows you to track individual checkout sessions
- Maintains discount security while providing seamless checkout experience

**When to disable:**
- You're using an affiliate platform that already handles discount protection
- You want to use the base discount code directly
- You have custom discount management logic

**Related:**
- [Maintained Discount Protection](/guides/features/maintained-discount-protection) — How discounts persist through checkout
- [Support Unique Discounts](/guides/dev/support-unique-discounts) — Technical implementation
- [Discount Code Management](/guides/enrichment/operations/discount-codes) — Auto-creation workflows

### Safe Discount Code Template

**Location:** Settings → Discount Settings → Safe Discount Code Template

**What it does:**
- Defines the format for auto-generated safe discount codes
- Can include dynamic variables: first name, last name, discount value
- Always appends a random number at the end for uniqueness

**Template variables:**
- `{FIRSTNAME}` — Creator's first name (uppercase)
- `{LASTNAME}` — Creator's last name (uppercase)
- `{DISCOUNT}` — Discount percentage or amount

**Examples:**

| Template | Example Output |
|----------|----------------|
| `{FIRSTNAME}{DISCOUNT}` | `SARAH20` + random → `SARAH201234` |
| `{FIRSTNAME}{LASTNAME}{DISCOUNT}` | `SARAHJONES20` + random → `SARAHJONES201234` |
| `{DISCOUNT}{FIRSTNAME}` | `20SARAH` + random → `20SARAH1234` |

**Important:** A random number is always appended to the end of the generated code, regardless of your template.

**Best practices:**
- Keep codes under 20 characters (before random number)
- Use meaningful combinations creators can remember
- Test that generated codes don't conflict with existing codes

- [Support Unique Discounts](/guides/dev/support-unique-discounts) — Technical implementation details

**When to disable:**
