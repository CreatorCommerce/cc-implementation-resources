## Native Shopify Architecture

CreatorCommerce is built entirely on Shopify's native primitives. There's no external rendering engine, no iframe overlay, and no separate storefront to maintain. Everything runs on your Shopify theme using standard Shopify features.

| Component | Shopify Primitive | How CC Uses It |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Creator data | **Metaobjects** | Each creator is a metaobject entry with profile, content, and product data |
| Landing pages | **Metaobject page templates** | Creator pages render via standard Shopify templates |
| Affiliate context | **Cart attributes** | The SDK writes `cc-creator-handle` to the cart for personalization |
| Discount application | **Shopify discounts** | Creator discount codes use native Shopify discount infrastructure |
| Order attribution | **Order tags & note attributes** | CC adds tags and attributes for reporting in Shopify admin |
| Customer segmentation | **Customer tags** | Creator-acquired customers are tagged automatically |

## Theme Compatibility

### Works with Any Online Store 2.0 Theme

CreatorCommerce is compatible with all Shopify Online Store 2.0 themes, including:

- **Dawn** (Shopify's reference theme)
- **Prestige**, **Impulse**, **Warehouse** (popular premium themes)
- **Custom themes** built on OS 2.0 architecture
- **Headless storefronts** via the Unified API

<Info>
Online Store 2.0 themes support JSON templates, sections everywhere, and app blocks -- all features CC leverages. If your theme was built or updated after mid-2021, it's almost certainly OS 2.0.
</Info>

### What CC Doesn't Touch

CreatorCommerce doesn't modify your theme files, override your CSS, or inject JavaScript that could conflict with other apps:

- **No theme file modifications** -- CC uses app blocks and metaobject data, not theme edits
- **No global JavaScript injection** -- The SDK is a lightweight, isolated script
- **No CSS overrides** -- Custom sections use your theme's existing styling tokens
- **No conflicting event listeners** -- Cart attribute writes use standard Shopify AJAX API

### Custom Theme Sections

When you build custom Liquid sections for co-branding, they follow standard Shopify section patterns:

```liquid
{% liquid
  if metaobject
    assign cc_creator = metaobject
  else
    assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']
    assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]
  endif
  
  assign has_creator = cc_creator != blank
%}

{% if has_creator %}
  <!-- Your co-branded UI -->
{% endif %}
```

This is standard Liquid -- no proprietary tags, no special syntax, no CC-specific dependencies. If you removed the CC app tomorrow, these sections would simply not render (graceful degradation).
