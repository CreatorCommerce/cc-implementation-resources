## Why Co-branded Messaging Matters

When a customer arrives through a creator's link, the trust that drove the click doesn't stop at the landing page. Every email, SMS, and notification that follows should reinforce that relationship.

**Generic emails after a creator-driven visit:**
- Feel disconnected from the experience that brought them in
- Lose the personal endorsement that drove the click
- Miss the opportunity to deepen the creator-customer bond

**Co-branded emails after a creator-driven visit:**
- Reference the creator by name in subject lines and body
- Include the creator's photo and endorsement
- Remind the shopper of their exclusive discount
- Link back to the creator's page for repeat visits

## The Impact

| Metric | Standard Emails | Co-branded Emails | Why |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Open rate | Baseline | +15-30% higher | Creator name in subject line drives curiosity |
| Click rate | Baseline | +20-40% higher | Familiar endorsement drives action |
| Cart recovery | Baseline | +25-50% higher | Discount reminder + creator context reduces hesitation |
| Repeat purchase | Baseline | Higher | Ongoing creator relationship drives return visits |

## How It Works

CreatorCommerce passes creator context through the entire customer journey:

```
Shopper clicks creator link
       |
CC SDK sets cart attributes (cc-creator-handle, cc-discount-code)
       |
Shopify Flow templates check creator context + fetch metaobject payload
       |
Klaviyo Track an Event logs B2C events with customer/event properties
       |
Email flows branch: creator-attributed vs. standard
       |
Co-branded emails sent with creator personalization
```

## B2C Event Set (Klaviyo)

For consumer-facing co-branded flows, use:

- `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
- `Creator Attributed Order`
- `Marketing Opt In From Creator`

These are generated by Shopify Flow templates and should stay separate from creator lifecycle event flows.

## What Gets Personalized

| Element | Data Source | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Subject line | Creator name | "Sarah saved these for you" |
| Header image | Creator profile photo | Creator photo + brand logo |
| Body copy | Creator name + endorsement | "The items Sarah picked for you are still available" |
| Discount block | Discount code + amount | "Use code SARAH15 for 15% off" |
| CTA link | Creator handle | Links back to creator's storefront page |
| Product recs | Creator's drops | Products the creator specifically curated |
