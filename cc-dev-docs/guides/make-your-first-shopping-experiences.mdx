## Three Ways to Launch

Before diving into code, choose your implementation approach. Each has different speed, customization, and complexity trade-offs.

| Approach | Speed | Customization | Best For |
|----------|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Pre-Built CC Sections** | ⚡⚡⚡ Fastest (30–60 min) | Low | Quick tests, proof of concept, getting live today |
| **Subtle Theme Modifications** | ⚡⚡ Balanced (1–2 hours) | Medium | Existing brands that want to keep their current design but add creator touches |
| **Experimental Bespoke** | ⚡ Moderate (2–4 hours) | High | Brands wanting something unique and on-brand |

</Card>

### Approach 1: Pre-Built CC Sections

Use CreatorCommerce's pre-built sections (files starting with `cc-` in your theme's `sections/` folder) to build a complete creator landing page template.

**What you do:**
1. Select 2–4 CC sections that match your brand personality (hero + products + optional banner)
2. Create a `templates/metaobject/creator.json` template that orders them
3. Configure basic settings in the Theme Editor

**Common sections:**
- `cc-hero-equinox.liquid` — High-impact animated hero
- `cc-hero-primavera-mini.liquid` — Clean, minimal hero
- `cc-drops-product-curated-lists-shell.liquid` — Product grid with drops
- `cc-banner-momentum.liquid` — Promotional banner

### Approach 2: Subtle Theme Modifications

Copy your current homepage template and make subtle modifications to add creator personalization. Your brand stays intact — you're just layering in creator context.

**What you do:**
1. Duplicate `templates/index.json` to create a creator version
2. Modify headlines to include creator name via dynamic text tokens
3. Add discount code display to CTAs
4. Optionally filter products to creator drops

**Key modifications:**
- **Headlines:** Use `[cc-creator-first-name]` tokens in text settings
- **Price display:** Add `cc-price.liquid` snippet to show creator discounts
- **Product grids:** Optionally filter to creator drops collections
- **Banners:** Display discount code prominently

### Approach 3: Experimental Bespoke

Start with your homepage as the foundation, then transform 2–3 key sections into something fresh and creator-forward. Keep the brand feel but add intentional creator elements.

**What you do:**
1. Start with `index.json` as your base
2. Pick 2–3 sections to transform (typically hero + product grid + one other)
3. Either enhance existing sections with creator data, replace them with CC sections, or build custom sections using CC data access patterns

**Best when you want:**
- A unique look that stands out from typical affiliate pages
- Creative flexibility to experiment with layouts
- A hybrid of your existing brand aesthetic with creator elements

<Tip>
**Not sure which approach?** Start with **Approach 1 (Pre-Built CC Sections)** — it gets you live fastest. You can always evolve to Approach 2 or 3 once you see what works. Or build all three and A/B test different approaches with different creator segments.

## Building Your First Experience

### Step 1: Access Creator Data

**Basic Pattern:**
```liquid
{% liquid
  if metaobject
    assign cc_creator = metaobject
  else
    assign cc_handle = cart.attributes['cc-creator-handle']
    assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle]
  endif
  
  assign has_creator = cc_creator != blank
%}

{% if has_creator %}
  <h1>Shop with {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}</h1>
{% endif %}
```

**What This Does:**
- Gets creator handle from cart attributes
- Looks up creator in metaobjects
- Accesses creator data
- Handles missing creator gracefully

### Step 2: Display Creator Profile

**Show Creator Information:**
```liquid
{% if cc_creator %}
  <div class="creator-header">
    {% if cc_creator.cc-creator-profile-picture %}
      <img src="{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-profile-picture }}" 
           alt="{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}">
    {% endif %}
    <h2>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }} {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-last-name }}</h2>
    {% if cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-description %}
      <p>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-description }}</p>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

### Step 3: Display Creator Drops

**Iterate Through Drops:**
```liquid
{% assign drops_json = cc_creator.data.value['cc-creator-drops'] %}
{% assign drops_collections = cc_creator['cc-creator-drops'].value %}

{% for json_drop in drops_json %}
  {% assign collection_id = json_drop['cc-creator-drop-collection-id'] %}
  
  {% for collection_drop in drops_collections %}
    {% if collection_drop.id | append: '' == collection_id %}
      <h3>{{ json_drop['cc-creator-drop-title'] | default: collection_drop.title }}</h3>
      
      {% for product in collection_drop.products limit: 10 %}
        {# Display product #}
      {% endfor %}
      {% break %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Step 4: Show Creator Discount

**Display Discount Code:**
```liquid
{% if cc_creator.data.value['cc-collab-discount-code'] %}
  <div class="discount-banner">
    Use code <strong>{{ cc_creator.data.value['cc-collab-discount-code'] }}</strong>
    for {{ cc_creator.data.value['cc-collab-discount-amount'] }}% off!
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

## Quick Start: Creator Landing Page

**Simple Implementation:**
1. Create new Shopify page template
2. Access creator via metaobject
3. Display creator profile
4. Show creator's drops
5. Add discount code display

**Result:**
- Personalized landing page
- Creator branding throughout
- Easy to share and link
- Converts creator traffic

## Quick Start: Product Review Section

**Show Creator's Product Note:**
```liquid
{% assign current_product_id = product.id | append: '' %}
{% assign product_enhancement = null %}

{% for json_drop in cc_creator.data.value['cc-creator-drops'] %}
  {% for drop_product in json_drop['cc-creator-drop-products'] %}
    {% if drop_product['cc-creator-drop-product-shopify-id'] == current_product_id %}
      {% if drop_product['cc-creator-drop-product-enhancement-note'] %}
        {% assign product_enhancement = drop_product %}
        {% break %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
  {% if product_enhancement %}{% break %}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% if product_enhancement %}
  <blockquote class="creator-review">
    "{{ product_enhancement['cc-creator-drop-product-enhancement-note'] }}"
    <cite>— {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}</cite>
  </blockquote>
{% endif %}
```

## Design Considerations

### Mobile-First

**Why:**
- Most creator traffic is mobile
- Instagram/TikTok links drive mobile visits
- Mobile experience is critical

**Best Practices:**
- Creator profile at top
- Discount code prominent
- Easy product scrolling
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Authenticity Over Polish

**What Works:**
- Creator photos (not stock)
- Real creator notes/reviews
- Creator voice and tone
- User-generated content

**What Doesn't Work:**
- Generic product descriptions
- Stock photography only
- Overly polished, inauthentic content
- Ignoring creator's voice

### Visual Hierarchy

**Priority Order:**
1. Creator profile (who they're shopping with)
2. Discount code (value proposition)
3. Products (what they're shopping for)
4. Additional content

### Brand Co-Branding

**Balance:**
- Creator branding visible
- Brand identity maintained
- Co-branded feel
- Professional appearance

## Testing Your Experience

### Test Checklist

**Before Launch:**
- [ ] Creator data displays correctly
- [ ] Drops load and display properly
- [ ] Discount codes work
- [ ] Product reviews/notes show
- [ ] Mobile experience works
- [ ] Fallbacks work (no creator context)
- [ ] Links function correctly
- [ ] Images load properly

### Test Scenarios

**With Creator Context:**
- Visit creator landing page
- Click creator link → product page
- Verify creator data appears
- Test discount code application

**Without Creator Context:**
- Visit storefront normally
- Verify neutral experience
- No broken images/links
- Graceful degradation

## Best Practices

### Always Handle Missing Data

**Defensive Coding:**
```liquid
{% if cc_creator and cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name %}
  {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}
{% else %}
  Featured Creator
{% endif %}
```

### Use Fallbacks

**For Missing Content:**
```liquid
{% assign creator_name = cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name | default: 'Creator' %}
{% assign creator_image = cc_creator.cc-creator-profile-picture | default: false %}
{% assign discount_code = cc_creator.data.value['cc-collab-discount-code'] | default: false %}
```

### Optimize Performance

**Lazy Load Images:**
```liquid
<img src="{{ creator_image }}" 
     alt="{{ creator_name }}"
     loading="lazy">
```

**Limit Product Iterations:**
```liquid
{% for product in collection.products limit: 12 %}
  {# Display product #}
{% endfor %}
```

## Next Steps

After building your first experience:

1. **Test Thoroughly** - Verify all scenarios work
2. **Track Performance** - Monitor metrics (see [Attribute & Analyze](/attribute-analyze))
3. **Iterate** - Improve based on data
4. **Scale** - Build more experiences (see [Optimize & Scale](/optimize-scale))
