---

Before you start building, orient around what matters most to your brand. CreatorCommerce is designed to help you tackle three fundamental business challenges through partnerships and collaborative shopping experiences: **Bigger Metrics**, **Bigger Moments**, and **Bigger Moats**.

## The Foundation: Collaborative Shopping Experiences

At its core, CreatorCommerce enables brands to build **collaborative shopping experiences** — where creators and brands come together to create authentic, personalized experiences that drive real business outcomes. These partnerships aren't just about affiliate links or sponsored posts; they're about building long-term relationships that compound value for everyone involved.

## The 3 M's Framework

### 1. Bigger Metrics

**What it means:** Achieving better business outcomes through creator partnerships.

**Why it matters:** Your existing metrics (conversion rate, AOV, CAC, LTV) get amplified when you tap into creator trust, authenticity, and engaged audiences.

#### Key Metrics CreatorCommerce Improves

**Conversion & Revenue Metrics:**
- **Higher conversion rates** - Authentic creator endorsement converts better than generic ads
- **Increased average order value (AOV)** - Creator-curated bundles and recommendations drive larger purchases
- **Lower customer acquisition cost (CAC)** - Creator audiences are pre-qualified and already trust the messenger
- **Improved customer lifetime value (LTV)** - Collaborative experiences create stronger emotional connections

**Engagement Metrics:**
- **Higher engagement rates** - Creator-driven content resonates more deeply
- **Longer session duration** - Personalized storefronts keep visitors engaged
- **More return visits** - Co-branded experiences create memorable touchpoints
- **Better email performance** - Creator-endorsed messaging improves open and click rates

#### How Collaborative Shopping Drives Metrics

**Authentic Social Proof**
- Real creator reviews and testimonials outperform generic product descriptions
- User-generated content from creator communities builds trust
- Creator stories and experiences humanize your brand

**Personalized Recommendations**
- Creator-curated drops act like a personal shopper experience
- Product recommendations feel authentic, not algorithmic
- Bundles and collections tell a story, not just a price

**Reduced Friction**
- Pre-qualified traffic from creator audiences
- Familiar faces and trusted voices reduce decision anxiety
- Creator discount codes create urgency and reduce price resistance

#### Before You Build: Questions to Ask

**Orientation Questions:**
- Which metric matters most right now? (Growth, efficiency, retention?)
- What's your current baseline for that metric?
- How will you measure the impact of creator partnerships?
- What success looks like in 30, 60, 90 days?

**Implementation Questions:**
- Which creator segments align with your highest-value customers?
- How will you attribute conversions to creators?
- What data will you track to optimize partnerships?

### 2. Bigger Moments
