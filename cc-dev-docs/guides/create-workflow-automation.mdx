description: 'Build automated workflows for partner onboarding, content collection, notifications, and operational efficiency.'

## Why Automate?

As your partner program grows, manual processes become bottlenecks. Automation lets you:

- **Scale without hiring** — Handle 1,000 partners like you handle 10
- **Ensure consistency** — Same experience for every partner
- **Reduce errors** — No forgotten follow-ups or missed steps
- **Save time** — Focus on strategy, not operations
