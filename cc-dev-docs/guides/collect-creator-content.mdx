## Why Collect Creator Content?

Your creators are a content goldmine. The content they create—photos, videos, quotes, testimonials—can power:

- **Co-branded storefronts** with authentic UGC
- **Email campaigns** with partner endorsements  
- **Paid ads** with whitelisted creator content
- **Product pages** with real customer photos
- **Social proof** across your site

<Info>
Content collection isn't a one-time event—it's an ongoing process. Build systems that make it easy for creators to contribute content regularly.
