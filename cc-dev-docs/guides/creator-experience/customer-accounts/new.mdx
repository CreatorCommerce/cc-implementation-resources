New Customer Accounts are Shopify's modern, extensible account system. You add functionality via app extensions, not theme code.

## Implementation Model

Use account extensions as the UI shell and keep creator/collab writes proxy-backed.

| Extension Surface | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| Dashboard block/page | Creator status, CTAs, quick stats |
| Products management page | Product assignment to drops |
| Collection editor page | Drop title/description/status/product order |

## Build Sequence

1. Build extension UI shells for each page/module
2. Add authenticated backend routes for collab/drop/product operations
3. Resolve creator context by authenticated customer identity
4. Bind section forms to `cc-*` field handles
5. Add toasts/loading/empty states and mobile-safe interactions

## Practical UX Patterns

- Keep dashboard page lightweight: status + links to specialized editors
- Use modal on larger screens and drawer on mobile for editing actions
- Batch save in product editing flows where multiple drop assignments can change
- Keep “informational only” panels in-account for guidance even when APIs are unavailable

## Partner Resolution Pattern

```javascript
import { useCustomer } from '@shopify/customer-account-ui-extensions';

function PartnerDashboard() {
  const customer = useCustomer();

  // Recommended: call your backend, not CC directly from extension
  const { data: collab } = useCollabByCustomer(customer.email);

  if (!collab) return null;
  return <DashboardEntry collab={collab} />;
}
```

## Security Checklist

- Backend validates customer ownership before each mutation
- CC credentials remain server-side only
- Write endpoints are rate-limited and logged
- Mutation failures return structured errors for deterministic UI handling
