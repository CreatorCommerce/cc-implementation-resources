For ambassador programs where partners are also customers, you can embed CC experiences directly in Shopify customer accounts.

## Why Customer Accounts?

- **No separate login** — Partners use their existing customer account
- **Familiar UX** — Shopify's account interface they already know
- **Lower friction** — One less system to remember

## Account Types

Shopify has two customer account systems:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Legacy Customer Accounts" icon="clock" href="/guides/creator-experience/customer-accounts/legacy">
    Classic Liquid-based accounts. Full customization via theme code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Customer Accounts" icon="sparkles" href="/guides/creator-experience/customer-accounts/new">
    Modern extensible accounts. Customize via app extensions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What You Can Add

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Partner dashboard link | Button/link to CC dashboard |
| Quick stats | Orders, earnings, performance |
| Product picker | In-account drop management |
| Profile editor | Bio, photo, social links |
| Share tools | Copy link, QR code |

## Partner Detection

Determine if the logged-in customer is a partner:

```liquid
{% assign customer_email = customer.email %}
{% comment %} Check if customer email matches a CC partner {% endcomment %}
{% assign is_partner = false %}

{% for creator in metaobjects.creator %}
  {% if creator.cc-creator-email == customer_email %}
    {% assign is_partner = true %}
    {% assign cc_creator = creator %}
    {% break %}
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
```
