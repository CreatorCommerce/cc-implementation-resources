description: 'Build creator dashboards directly in Shopify customer accounts with a multi-page, proxy-backed architecture.'

For ambassador programs where partners are also customers, you can embed CC experiences directly in Shopify customer accounts.

## Why Customer Accounts

- **No separate login** — Partners use their existing customer account
- **Familiar UX** — Shopify's account interface they already know
- **Lower friction** — One less system to remember

## Account Types

Shopify has two customer account systems:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Legacy Customer Accounts" icon="clock" href="/guides/creator-experience/customer-accounts/legacy">
    Classic Liquid-based accounts. Full customization via theme code.
  </Card>
  <Card title="New Customer Accounts" icon="sparkles" href="/guides/creator-experience/customer-accounts/new">
    Modern extensible accounts. Customize via app extensions.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recommended Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Account templates/extensions | UI and interaction |
| Hidden customer context | Bootstrapping customer identity |
| Backend proxy | Auth checks + CC/Shopify API orchestration |
| CC data model | Creators, collabs, drops, enhancements, custom fields |

## Suggested Page Split

- Dashboard home
- Manage products
- Collection editor
- Storefront editor

This keeps each workflow focused and easier to maintain.

## Identity + Partner Detection

Use customer account identity, then resolve creator/collab server-side:

```liquid
{% if customer.email %}
  <div data-customer-email="{{ customer.email }}" style="display:none;"></div>
{% endif %}
```

Frontend reads `data-customer-email` and calls your backend to resolve partner context. Avoid looping all creator metaobjects in Liquid for this detection step.
