Use this when a brand is on Shopify Legacy Customer Accounts.

The use case is the same as [New Customer Accounts](/guides/creator-experience/customer-accounts/new):

- creator account dashboard experiences
- creator-aware management flows
- secure proxy-backed writes to creator/collab/drop data

The main difference:

- **Legacy is Liquid-based**, so you can edit templates, sections, and snippets directly in theme code.

## What Changes in Legacy

- UI is implemented in Liquid templates/sections instead of extension surfaces
- You can customize markup/logic directly in theme files
- You are responsible for theme-level maintainability across updates

## Recommended Technical Pattern (Still Applies)

- Keep authentication in Shopify customer accounts
- Resolve creator/collab context server-side
- Keep CC writes behind your backend proxy
- Keep credentials out of Liquid and browser bundles
