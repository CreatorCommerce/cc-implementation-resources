description: 'Partner apps and platforms that integrate with CC for seamless creator experiences.'
---

Some partner platforms integrate directly with CreatorCommerce, providing a unified experience where partners manage everything in one place.

## What "Unified" Means

Instead of:
- Log into affiliate platform → manage commissions
- Log into CC dashboard → customize shop
- Log into brand portal → access assets

With unified apps:
- Log into one platform → manage everything

## Integrated Platforms

### Affiliate Networks

| Platform | Integration Type |
|----------|------------------|
| Impact | Deep link + SSO |
| ShareASale | Embedded CC UI |
| Refersion | API sync + SSO |

### CRM & Partner Management

| Platform | Integration Type |
|----------|------------------|
| HubSpot | Embedded dashboard |
| Salesforce | Connected app |
| PartnerStack | Native integration |

### Custom Portals

Build CC into your own partner portal:
- Embed CC forms/dashboard via iframe
- Use CC APIs for custom UI
- Pass authentication via SSO

## Building Unified Experiences

### Option 1: Embed CC Dashboard

Embed the full CC dashboard in your app:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://partners.yourbrand.com/dashboard?sso_token={token}" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800"
></iframe>
```

### Option 2: API-Powered Custom UI

Build your own UI, use CC APIs for data:

```javascript
// Fetch partner data
const partner = await cc.creators.get(partnerId);

// Submit updates
await cc.creators.update(partnerId, {
  bio: newBio,
  products: selectedProducts
});
```

### Option 3: Deep Links with SSO

Link to CC with automatic authentication:

```
https://partners.yourbrand.com/form/products?
  sso_token={token}&
  redirect_after=/dashboard
```
