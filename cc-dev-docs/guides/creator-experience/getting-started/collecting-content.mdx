Before you can co-brand experiences, you need content from your partners—bios, product picks, images, social handles, preferences. Here's how to collect it.

## Collection Methods

### CC-Powered Surfaces

CreatorCommerce provides ready-to-use collection interfaces:

- **CC Dashboard** — Full-featured partner portal with forms, product pickers, analytics
- **CC Forms** — Embeddable forms for specific data collection
- **App Blocks** — Shopify customer account extensions

### Build Your Own

If you need custom UX:

- **CC APIs** — Full programmatic access to read/write partner data
- **Webhooks** — React to events in your own systems
- **Custom forms** — Submit to CC via API

### Skip Collection Entirely

You can also populate partner data without asking them:

- **CC Admin Dashboard** — Your team enters content directly
- **Import tools** — Bulk import from spreadsheets or other systems
- **Workflows** — Auto-generate content with AI from minimal data

## Data You'll Collect

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Identity | Name, bio, headshot, social handles |
| Preferences | Product picks, collections, bundles |
| Custom fields | Shoe size, skin type, specialty areas |
| Credentials | Certifications, years of experience |
| Styling | Brand colors, font preferences |
