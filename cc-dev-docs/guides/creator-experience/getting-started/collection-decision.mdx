title: 'How to Make a Collection Decision'
description: 'Choosing the right approach for collecting content from your partners.'
---

The right collection strategy depends on your program size, partner types, and existing infrastructure.

## Decision Framework

### Question 1: How many partners?

| Count | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| < 50 | Admin-managed or simple forms |
| 50-500 | CC Dashboard with forms |
| 500+ | Full automation with workflows |

### Question 2: Do partners already use a tool?

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Partners use your affiliate platform | Embed CC or deep link with SSO |
| Partners use Shopify customer accounts | Customer account UI |
| Partners use nothing yet | CC Dashboard as standalone |

### Question 3: What data do you need?

| Data Type | Best Collection Method |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Basic profile (name, bio) | Onboarding form |
| Product picks | Product picker form |
| Custom fields | Custom forms |
| Ongoing updates | Dashboard access |

### Question 4: How branded does it need to be?

| Need | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| "Good enough" | CC Dashboard with CSS customization |
| Fully branded | CC Dashboard with full theming |
| Completely custom | Build your own with CC APIs |

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Ambassador Program

- **Entry:** Email invite with magic link
- **Collection:** CC Dashboard with product picker
- **Updates:** Dashboard access ongoing

### Pattern: Professional Network

- **Entry:** Embedded in existing partner portal
- **Collection:** Custom forms for credentials
- **Updates:** SSO access to CC Dashboard

### Pattern: Micro-Influencer Campaign

- **Entry:** Direct URL shared in DMs
- **Collection:** Simple onboarding form
- **Updates:** Email-triggered form links

### Pattern: Customer-to-Affiliate

- **Entry:** Shopify customer account
- **Collection:** In-account forms
- **Updates:** Customer account UI

## Hybrid Approaches

You can mix methods:

- **Onboarding:** Simple form via email
- **Product selection:** Dashboard access
- **Profile updates:** Customer account UI

## Start Simple

Don't over-engineer. Start with:
1. One onboarding form
2. One product picker
3. Dashboard access for power users

Add complexity only when partners ask for it.
