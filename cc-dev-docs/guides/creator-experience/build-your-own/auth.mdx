Authentication in a custom creator dashboard has two layers:

1. Shopper/creator identity (usually Shopify customer account auth)
2. Backend authorization to read/write creator + collab data

## Recommended Pattern

Use Shopify customer accounts for sign-in, then authorize all dashboard data actions through your backend proxy.

```text
Customer logs in with Shopify account
-> Theme/extension gets authenticated customer context
-> Frontend sends request to your backend
-> Backend validates session + maps customer to creator/collab
-> Backend calls CreatorCommerce APIs
```

Why this is preferred:
- No API secrets in the browser
- Cleaner permission boundaries
- Easier auditing and rate limiting
- Safer handling of write operations (drop updates, profile edits, uploads)

## Identity Bootstrap in UI

In customer-account pages, expose only minimal identity context:

```liquid
{% if customer.email %}
  <div data-customer-email="{{ customer.email }}" style="display:none;"></div>
{% endif %}
```

Your JS can then read that value and call your backend.

## Customer -> Creator Resolution

Resolve creator/collab server-side by trusted identity (email, customer ID, or both):

```javascript
// Backend route example
app.get('/api/dashboard/collab', async (req, res) => {
  const customer = await requireAuthenticatedCustomer(req);
  const collab = await getCollabByCustomerIdentity(customer);
  res.json(collab);
});
```

Avoid resolving partner status by looping every creator metaobject in Liquid on each page view.

## Token Strategy

If your backend calls CreatorCommerce APIs:
- Keep CC keys/tokens server-side only
- Use short-lived session auth between browser and your backend
- Rotate secrets and log outbound API calls

## Optional SSO Patterns

If you run a separate creator portal outside customer accounts:
- SSO from your existing identity system
- Magic-link entry flows
- CC-issued auth flow where applicable

Still keep write operations proxy-based through your backend.

## Session + Access Control Checklist

- Enforce authenticated customer session on every dashboard endpoint
- Verify customer is mapped to the collab/drop being modified
- Reject cross-collab writes even if IDs are guessed
- Rate-limit write routes (`updateDrop`, `updateCollab`, `createDrop`, enhancement updates)
- Return normalized error payloads so UI can show deterministic toasts
