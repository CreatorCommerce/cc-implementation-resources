Your dashboard UI can be hosted almost anywhere. The important choice is where your secure proxy runs.

## Recommended Deployment Shape

```text
Theme/customer-account UI
  -> calls
Backend proxy (auth + CC + Shopify operations)
  -> calls
CreatorCommerce + Shopify APIs
```

This keeps API keys and write permissions off the client.

## Hosting Options

### UI Layer

- Shopify theme + customer account templates
- Embedded app UI/extensions
- External React/Next frontend

### Proxy/API Layer

- Serverless functions (Vercel/AWS/Cloudflare)
- Container app (Render/Railway/Fly/DO App Platform)
- Existing backend service in your stack

### File Upload Layer (Optional)

- Direct upload to your own storage/CDN
- Upload worker service, then save returned media URL in CC enhancement/custom fields

## Endpoint Design (Proxy)

Example backend routes:

- `GET /api/dashboard/collab?email=...`
- `POST /api/dashboard/update-collab`
- `POST /api/dashboard/update-drop`
- `POST /api/dashboard/create-drop`
- `POST /api/dashboard/update-product-enhancement`
- `PATCH /api/dashboard/update-affiliate`

Keep the frontend unaware of upstream credential details.

## Practical Notes

- Use one canonical base URL per environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`)
- Add request timeouts and structured errors on all routes
- Log route, collabId/dropId, and status for operational debugging
- Prefer idempotent update flows when possible

## Security Baseline

- Do not call privileged CC endpoints directly from browser JS
- Do not expose CC tokens/API keys in Liquid or frontend bundles
- Validate customer identity and collab ownership on every write
- Apply rate limiting + basic abuse protections to mutation endpoints
