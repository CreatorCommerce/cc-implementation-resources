Your custom dashboard needs a home. Options range from simple static hosting to full application platforms.

## Options

### Static Hosting

For simple dashboards (API calls from browser):

| Service | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| Vercel | React/Next.js apps | Free tier available |
| Netlify | Static sites, Jamstack | Free tier available |
| Cloudflare Pages | Global CDN | Free tier available |

**Pros:** Simple, cheap, fast
**Cons:** Limited server-side logic

### Serverless

For dashboards needing backend logic:

| Service | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| Vercel Functions | Next.js API routes | Usage-based |
| AWS Lambda | Custom backends | Usage-based |
| Cloudflare Workers | Edge logic | Usage-based |

**Pros:** Scalable, no server management
**Cons:** Cold starts, complexity

### Full Application Hosting

For complex dashboards:

| Service | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| Render | Full-stack apps | $7+/month |
| Railway | Rapid deployment | Usage-based |
| Heroku | Traditional apps | $7+/month |

**Pros:** Full control, any architecture
**Cons:** More management

### Embedded in Existing App

If you have an existing partner portal:

- Add CC integration to your current app
- Use your existing hosting
- No additional infrastructure

## Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Simple read-only dashboard | Static (Vercel/Netlify) |
| Forms + updates | Static + serverless |
| Complex workflows | Full application |
| Existing partner portal | Embed in current |

## Domain Setup

### Subdomain of your site
```
partners.yourbrand.com → Your dashboard
```

### Custom domain
```
dashboard.yourpartnerprogram.com → Your dashboard
```

## CORS Configuration

Your dashboard will call CC APIs from the browser. Ensure your domain is allowlisted in CC settings.
