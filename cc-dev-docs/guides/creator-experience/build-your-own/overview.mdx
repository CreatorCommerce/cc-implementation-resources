title: 'Build Your Own Dashboard'
description: 'Create custom partner experiences using CC APIs and your own infrastructure.'
---

When CC's hosted dashboard doesn't fit your needs, build your own using CC APIs.

## When to Build Custom

- Unique UX requirements
- Deep integration with existing tools
- Complete brand control
- Custom workflows not supported by CC

## What You'll Build

| Component | CC Provides | You Build |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Data storage | ✓ Metaobjects, API | — |
| Authentication | Tokens, SSO | Login UI, session |
| Partner data | Read/write APIs | Forms, displays |
| Products | Catalog access | Picker UI |
| Hosting | — | Your infrastructure |
