title: 'Build Your Own Dashboard'
description: 'Build a custom creator dashboard with Shopify customer accounts, CC data, and your own secure backend.'
---

When CC's hosted dashboard is not enough, build your own creator dashboard with your own UX, flows, and infrastructure.

## What This Guide Covers

- Dashboard architecture for Shopify customer-account experiences
- Secure API patterns (proxy-first, not browser-direct)
- Real implementation patterns for:
  - Collections/drops management
  - Storefront editing and custom fields
  - Product-level enhancements (notes/media)
  - Informational, non-network dashboard panels

## Build Pattern (Recommended)

```text
Customer Account UI (Liquid or Extensions)
  -> Reads customer identity context
  -> Renders dashboard pages and forms
  -> Calls your backend proxy only

Your Backend Proxy (required)
  -> Validates identity/session
  -> Calls CreatorCommerce APIs
  -> Calls Shopify APIs when needed
  -> Normalizes payloads for frontend

CreatorCommerce + Shopify
  -> Creator/collab/drop data
  -> Product/catalog data
  -> Cart/order context
```
