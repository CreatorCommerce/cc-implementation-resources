## Personalization

Use CC data for personalization:

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `firstName` | Partner profile | "Hi Sarah" |
| `shopUrl` | CC-generated | "yourbrand.com/p/sarah" |
| `discountCode` | Partner assignment | "SARAH20" |
| `discountAmount` | Partner tier | "20%" |

## Best Practices

- **Short and focused** — One CTA per email
- **Mobile-friendly** — Most partners read on mobile
- **Value-first** — What's in it for them
- **Clear next step** — What should they do now
