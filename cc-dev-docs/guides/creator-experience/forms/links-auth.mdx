Understanding how partners access CC forms and dashboard.

## Link Types

### Public Form Links

Anyone with the link can submit:

```
https://partners.yourbrand.com/form/apply
```

**Use for:** Application forms, public signups

### Authenticated Links

Requires partner to be logged in:

```
https://partners.yourbrand.com/dashboard
https://partners.yourbrand.com/form/products
```

**Use for:** Partner-only forms, dashboard access

### Magic Links

One-time use, auto-authenticates:

```
https://partners.yourbrand.com/dashboard?token=abc123xyz
```

**Use for:** Email invites, frictionless access

### SSO Links

Passes identity from your system:

```
https://partners.yourbrand.com/dashboard?sso_token={your_token}
```

**Use for:** Embedded access, partner portals

## Authentication Methods

### Magic Links (Recommended)

1. Partner requests access or you send invite
2. CC emails magic link
3. Partner clicks, automatically logged in
4. Session persists for configured duration

**Pros:** Frictionless, no password to remember
**Cons:** Requires email access

### Password

1. Partner sets password during signup
2. Logs in with email + password
3. Password reset via email

**Pros:** Traditional, familiar
**Cons:** Password fatigue, reset requests

### SSO (SAML/OAuth)

1. Partner logs into your system
2. Your system generates SSO token
3. CC validates and creates session

**Pros:** Single sign-on, enterprise-ready
**Cons:** Setup required

### Shopify Customer Identity

1. Partner logs into Shopify customer account
2. CC app block accesses identity
3. Seamless in-account experience

**Pros:** No separate login
**Cons:** Only for customer-partners

## Session Management

| Setting | Default | Options |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Session duration | 7 days | 1 hour - 30 days |
| Remember me | Enabled | Enable/disable |
| Multi-device | Allowed | Allow/restrict |

## Security

- All links are HTTPS
- Magic links expire after use
- Sessions can be revoked
- Audit logs available

## Generating Links

### In CC Admin

1. Go to Partners → [Partner Name]
2. Click "Generate Access Link"
3. Choose type (magic link, direct, SSO)
4. Copy and share

### Via API

```javascript
const link = await cc.auth.generateMagicLink({
  partnerId: "abc123",
  redirectTo: "/form/products",
  expiresIn: "24h"
});
```
