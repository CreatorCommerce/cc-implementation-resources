Custom forms let you collect any structured data from partners. Use when standard forms don't fit your needs.

## When to Use Custom Forms

- Collecting program-specific data (certifications, specialties)
- Gathering information for custom experiences
- Unique data requirements per partner segment
- Integration with external systems

## Building Custom Forms

### Field Types

| Type | Example Use |
|------|-------------|
| Text | Certification number, specialty |
| Number | Years of experience, follower count |
| Select | Primary platform, content style |
| Multi-select | Areas of expertise |
| Date | Certification date, anniversary |
| File | License upload, portfolio |
| URL | Portfolio link, other social |
| Checkbox | Terms acceptance, opt-ins |
| Radio | Single choice from options |

### Conditional Logic

Show/hide fields based on answers:

```
If "Are you a licensed professional?" = Yes
  Show: License number, State, Expiration date
Else
  Hide those fields
```

### Validation Rules

- Required fields
- Format validation (email, URL, phone)
- Custom regex patterns
- Cross-field validation

## Mapping to Custom Fields

Form submissions map to CC custom fields:

```
Form field: "Years of Experience"
Maps to: cc-creator-years-experience

Form field: "Primary Platform"
Maps to: cc-creator-primary-platform
```

## API Integration

Submit custom form data via API:

```javascript
await cc.creators.update(partnerId, {
  customFields: {
    "cc-certification-number": "RD12345",
    "cc-specialty-areas": ["nutrition", "sports"],
    "cc-years-experience": 10
  }
});
```
