Onboarding forms capture partner information during initial signup. This is often the first interaction partners have with your program.

<Info>
**Configure onboarding settings first.** Before building your onboarding forms, set up the splash screen content (title, description, perks) in **Settings → Onboarding Settings**. This content appears before creators see the form fields.
