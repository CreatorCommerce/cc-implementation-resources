## Best Practices

### Keep It Short

First impression matters. Collect essentials only:
- 5-7 fields max for initial form
- Use progressive collection for more data

### Explain Why

Partners are more likely to share if they understand:
- "Your bio appears on your landing page"
- "We'll use your photo in co-branded emails"

### Provide Examples

Show what good looks like:
- Example bios
- Recommended photo specs
- Sample social handle format

### Mobile-Friendly

Many partners will complete on mobile:
- Large touch targets
- Single-column layout
- Minimal typing required
