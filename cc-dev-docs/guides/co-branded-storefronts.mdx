## What Are Co-branded Storefronts?

A co-branded storefront is a personalized shopping experience on **your existing Shopify store** that dynamically adapts based on which creator referred the shopper. Instead of sending affiliate traffic to a generic product page, every click leads to a page that feels like it was built just for that creator and their audience.

```
Creator shares link → Shopper clicks → Lands on personalized page → Shops with context
```

**What can change per creator:**
- Hero sections with their name, photo, and bio
- Their curated product picks (drops)
- Personalized quotes, notes, and media
- Their exclusive discount code
- Brand colors or accent adjustments
- Any code-level component on the store

**What stays the same:**
- Your Shopify theme and infrastructure
- Your checkout, fulfillment, and operations
- Your product catalog and pricing logic
- Your analytics and order management

## How It Works

CreatorCommerce uses three Shopify-native building blocks:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Metaobjects" icon="database">
    Creator data (name, bio, products, media) stored as Shopify metaobjects — accessible in Liquid like any other Shopify data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cart Attributes" icon="cart-shopping">
    The CC SDK writes `cc-creator-handle` to the cart when a shopper arrives via an affiliate link — this attribute persists through checkout
  </Card>
  <Card title="Templates" icon="browser">
    Shopify metaobject page templates serve as creator landing pages; theme sections personalize any other page using the cart attribute
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Two Approaches

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="App Blocks (No Code)">
    Use pre-built CreatorCommerce app blocks in the Shopify theme editor:

    - Drag and drop creator hero, product grid, quote badge, and discount banners
    - Configure via the visual editor
    - No developer required for basic setups
    - Good for getting started quickly

    **Best for:** Teams without dev resources, quick launches, testing layouts
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom Theme Sections (Code)">
    Build custom Liquid sections that read directly from the creator metaobject:

    - Full control over layout and design
    - Access to all creator data fields including custom fields
    - Conditional rendering based on creator presence
    - Full-funnel personalization across every page

    **Best for:** Brands that want pixel-perfect control, complex layouts, full-funnel personalization
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What You Can Personalize

| Touchpoint | What Changes | How |
|------------|-------------|-----|
| **Landing pages** | Full creator showcase — hero, bio, products, media | Metaobject page template |
| **Navigation banners** | "Shopping with Sarah" persistent header | Theme section reading cart attributes |
| **Collection pages** | Creator's curated collection highlighted | Cart attribute context |
| **Product pages** | Creator quote, why-I-love-it note, UGC | Cart attribute + metaobject data |
| **Cart drawers** | Discount reminder, savings display | Cart attribute |
| **Checkout** | Auto-applied discount code | Shopify discount integration |
| **Post-purchase** | Creator thank-you message | Order attributes |
| **Any code-level component** | Anything you need | Use variables dfirectly in it |
