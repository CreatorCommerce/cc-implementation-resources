# Setting up Rules for Claude Code

Configure Claude Code rules to ensure consistent code generation and best practices for CreatorCommerce development.

## Overview

Claude Code rules help guide the AI assistant to generate code that follows your project's conventions and best practices. This is especially important for CreatorCommerce projects where specific patterns and rules must be followed.

## Creating Rules Files

Claude Code rules can be configured through various methods depending on your setup.

### Using Project Configuration

Claude Code can read rules from configuration files in your project. Check your Claude Code documentation for the specific format required.

### Basic Rule Structure

```

## Common Rules for CreatorCommerce

### Data Reference Rules

```markdown
When referencing creator data:
- Always check for creator context first

```

### Code Organization Rules

```markdown
- Keep Liquid logic in liquid blocks when possible
- Use descriptive variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Project-Specific Rules**: Add rules that are specific to your CreatorCommerce implementation
2. **Reference Existing Code**: Point Claude to existing patterns in your codebase
3. **Update Regularly**: Keep rules updated as patterns evolve
4. **Test Rules**: Verify that Claude follows your rules correctly

## Configuration Methods
