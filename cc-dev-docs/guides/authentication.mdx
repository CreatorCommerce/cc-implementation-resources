title: Authentication
---

The CreatorCommerce Unified API supports multiple authentication methods depending on your use case.

## Authentication Methods

### Bearer Token (JWT)

For authenticated user requests, use Bearer token authentication. Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

**When to use:**
- Authenticated user requests
- Requests from the CreatorCommerce dashboard
- User-initiated API calls

### API Key Authentication

For server-to-server communication, use API key authentication via custom headers:

```bash
x-channel-access-token: <your-channel-token>
```

or

```bash
x-partner-access-token: <your-partner-token>
```

**When to use:**
- Server-to-server integrations
- Partner API access
- Channel-specific operations

### Admin Access Token

For administrative operations, you can use:

```bash
x-admin-access-token: <your-admin-token>
```

**When to use:**
- Administrative operations
- System-level integrations

## Getting Your Credentials

### JWT Tokens

JWT tokens are obtained through the CreatorCommerce authentication flow. These tokens are typically short-lived and should be refreshed as needed.

### API Keys

API keys are provided when you:
- Set up a channel integration
- Register as a partner
- Configure administrative access

Contact CreatorCommerce Support to obtain API keys for your use case.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to version control** - Store API keys and tokens in environment variables or secure secret management systems
2. **Use HTTPS only** - All API requests must use HTTPS
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Periodically rotate your API keys for security
4. **Use the principle of least privilege** - Only request the permissions you need
5. **Monitor token expiration** - Implement proper token refresh logic for JWT tokens

## Example Requests

### Using Bearer Token

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://unified-api.creatorcommerce.shop/creators/collabs?myshopify_domain=example.myshopify.com' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...'
```

### Using API Key

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'https://unified-api.creatorcommerce.shop/creators/collabs?myshopify_domain=example.myshopify.com' \
  -H 'x-channel-access-token: your-channel-token-here'
```

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired token"
}
```

## Token Expiration

JWT tokens have expiration times. Monitor the token expiration and implement refresh logic. API keys typically don't expire but can be revoked by administrators.
