## Build Something

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Co-branded hero section">
    ```text
    Help me build a co-branded hero section that uses CreatorCommerce.
    It should display the creator's name, profile picture, and a short
    bio. Use the creator metaobject data and include a neutral fallback
    for when no creator context is present.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creator product grid with drops">
    ```text
    I need a product grid section that displays a creator's curated
    product lists (drops). Each drop should have its own title and
    description, with products pulled from the associated Shopify
    collection. Follow the CreatorCommerce drops data model.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Convert an existing section to support drops">
    ```text
    I have an existing Shopify section that displays products from a
    collection. Help me convert it to also support CreatorCommerce
    drops while keeping the original collection behavior as a fallback.
    Here's my current section code: [paste your section]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build a creator directory">
    ```text
    Help me build a creator directory section where shoppers can browse
    all public creators in a responsive grid. Each card should show the
    creator's profile picture, name, and a short bio. Include filtering
    by category and a "similar creators" mode based on shared attributes.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create a new co-branded section from scratch">
    ```text
    Help me create a new co-branded testimonial section that shows a
    creator's quote, profile picture, and name. It should use dynamic
    text tokens so the merchant can customize the heading, support the
    Theme Editor preview with a creator picker, and fall back gracefully
    when no creator context is present.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Conditional popup blocking during creator funnels">
    ```text
    Help me write a JavaScript snippet for theme.liquid that hides
    newsletter popups and discount modals when a shopper is in a
    creator funnel (has an active creator context with a discount).
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Plan a Strategy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creator program P&L">
    ```text
    Help me build out a P&L for my creator program. I need to
    understand my commission ceiling, break-even per creator, and
    how to structure tiers. Walk me through it step by step.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="End-to-end collab strategy">
    ```text
    I'm launching a creator collaboration program for my DTC brand.
    Help me design the full strategy — who to recruit, how to
    activate them, what the shopper experience should look like,
    and how to measure success.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Campaign ideation with co-branded emails">
    ```text
    Help me ideate on a new campaign that uses co-branded emails
    post-purchase. I want to re-engage customers who bought through
    a creator's link with follow-up emails featuring that creator's
    recommendations and discount code.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CreatorCommerce fit discovery">
    ```text
    I have a sales call with a DTC skincare brand that does $2M/year
    and has 50 affiliates on Social Snowball. Help me run a fit
    discovery to determine if CreatorCommerce is right for them and
    build a tailored value narrative if it is.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Debug an Issue

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Creator data not appearing">
    ```text
    My creator's name and bio aren't showing up on the landing page.
    The section works in the Theme Editor but is blank on the live
    site. What should I check?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Discount not applying">
    ```text
    My creator discount isn't showing on product pages. The cart
    attribute is set but the price doesn't change. Walk me through
    the debugging steps.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Drops products not rendering">
    ```text
    I'm iterating through a creator's drops but no products are
    showing up. The drop titles display fine. Help me figure out
    why the product loop is empty.
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Learn a Concept

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How the creator data model works">
    ```text
    Explain how CreatorCommerce stores creator data in Shopify.
    What are metaobjects, how do I access creator fields in Liquid,
    and what's the difference between top-level fields and nested
    data.value fields?
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why collections instead of all_products">
    ```text
    Why does CreatorCommerce use Shopify collections for drop
    products instead of all_products[]? Explain the technical
    limitation and how collections solve it.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Full-funnel personalization">
    ```text
    What does full-funnel personalization mean in CreatorCommerce?
    How does creator context persist from the landing page through
    product pages, cart, checkout, and post-purchase emails?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific.** "Help me build a hero section" is good. "Help me build a hero section with the creator's profile picture, name, and a gradient background using their brand colors" is better.
- **Share your code.** If you're modifying an existing section, paste the current code so the AI can preserve your existing functionality.
- **Mention your theme.** Dawn, Prestige, custom — the theme matters for snippet naming and conventions.
- **Reference these docs.** If using Cursor with MCP, you can point to specific doc pages: "Using the patterns from the drops data model reference, help me..."
