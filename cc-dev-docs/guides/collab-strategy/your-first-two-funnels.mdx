## The Two-Funnel Strategy

Before scaling to hundreds of creator pages, start with two test funnels that prove the concept and establish your co-branding approach.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Funnel A: Out-of-the-Box" icon="box">
    Use pre-built CC sections for fast deployment. Perfect for validating the concept.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Funnel B: Theme-Native" icon="paintbrush">
    Convert your existing sections for seamless brand consistency. Better long-term scalability.
  </Card>

## Funnel A: Out-of-the-Box CC Sections

### What You Get

CreatorCommerce provides ready-made Liquid sections that work immediately:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **CC Hero** | Creator photo, name, bio, and discount callout |
| **CC Product Grid** | Displays creator's "drops" with discounted pricing |
| **CC Quote Badge** | Creator testimonial on product cards |
| **CC Banner** | Persistent discount reminder |
| **CC Email Capture** | Newsletter signup with creator attribution |

### When to Use This Approach

- **Testing the waters** — Validate co-branding before committing development time
- **Fast launch** — Get live in hours, not weeks
- **Limited dev resources** — No custom development required
- **Proof of concept** — Show stakeholders what's possible

### The Tradeoff

Out-of-the-box sections may not perfectly match your existing theme aesthetic. They're designed to be functional and good-looking, but they won't have your exact fonts, spacing, or component patterns.

### Implementation Path

1. Install CC sections from the template library
2. Add sections to your metaobject template
3. Configure section settings (colors, layout options)
4. Assign a test creator to preview
5. Launch with a small cohort of partners

**Time to launch:** 2-4 hours for basic setup

## Funnel B: Converting Your Theme Sections

### What You Get

Take the sections you've already built and perfected—your hero, your product grid, your testimonial blocks—and make them creator-aware.

| Your Section | What Changes |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Hero section** | Add creator photo, name, bio fields |
| **Product grid** | Pull from creator's drops instead of static collection |
| **Testimonial block** | Display creator's quote about products |
| **Header/nav** | Show creator context for returning visitors |
| **Price display** | Calculate and show discounted prices |

### When to Use This Approach

- **Brand consistency is critical** — Your theme represents years of design iteration
- **Long-term scalability** — One codebase, many creators
- **Custom functionality** — Need specific features your sections already have
- **Developer capacity** — You have resources to implement properly

### The Tradeoff

Requires development time upfront. Someone needs to modify Liquid templates to read creator data and conditionally display co-branded content.

### Implementation Path

1. Identify 3-5 key sections to convert (hero, product grid, etc.)
2. Add creator data resolution logic
3. Create conditional rendering for creator vs. non-creator views
4. Build fallback states for when no creator context exists
5. Test with multiple creator profiles
6. Launch alongside Funnel A for A/B comparison

<Info>
**Time to launch:** 1-2 weeks depending on complexity

## Running Both Funnels

### Why Test Both?

Running Funnel A and Funnel B simultaneously gives you data to make informed decisions:

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Conversion rate** | Does brand consistency matter to your customers? |
| **Bounce rate** | Are visitors confused by different aesthetics? |
| **Time on page** | Which layout keeps attention longer? |
| **AOV** | Does one approach drive larger carts? |
| **Creator feedback** | Which version do partners prefer to share? |

### Test Structure

```
Creator Cohort A (10 partners)
  └── Funnel A: Out-of-the-box sections
  
Creator Cohort B (10 partners)
  └── Funnel B: Theme-native sections
  
Run for: 30 days
Primary metric: Conversion rate
Secondary: AOV, creator satisfaction
```

### Decision Framework

After 30 days of data:

- **Funnel A wins significantly** → Stick with out-of-the-box, invest in customizing those sections
- **Funnel B wins significantly** → Commit to theme-native approach, convert more sections
- **Results are similar** → Choose based on maintenance burden and team preference
- **Both underperform** → Review landing page content, not just design

## What Each Funnel Needs

### Minimum Viable Funnel

Both approaches need these core elements:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creator Hero">
    Above-the-fold introduction with photo, name, and value prop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Product Showcase">
    Creator's recommended products with clear pricing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discount Visibility">
    Code prominently displayed, savings calculated
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear CTA">
    "Shop [Creator]'s Picks" or similar action
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Nice-to-Have Elements

- Creator video or UGC content
- "Why I love this" product quotes
- Social proof (follower count, credentials)
- Email capture with creator context
- Exit-intent discount reminder
