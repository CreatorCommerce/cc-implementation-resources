## Storefronts That Convert

This is the heart of CreatorCommerce: **co-branded storefronts** that make every partner's link a personalized shopping experience.

A great co-branded storefront:
- **Feels personal** — Visitors know they're in [Partner]'s space
- **Builds trust** — Partner endorsement creates credibility
- **Drives action** — Clear paths to purchase
- **Reflects brand** — Your brand elevated, not replaced

## Funnel Testing Framework

Every storefront is a hypothesis. Test systematically to find what converts.

### Key Variables to Test

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Partner Presentation">
    **Test variations:**
    - Photo size and placement
    - Name prominence
    - Bio length and content
    - Credential display
    - Video vs. static image
    
    **Hypothesis to validate:**

    - How much UGC is optimal?
    - Does UGC type matter (styled vs. casual)?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product Recommendations">
    **Test variations:**
    - Number of featured products (3 vs. 6 vs. 12)

    **Hypothesis to validate:**
    - Does curation increase conversion?
    - What's the optimal number of products?
    - Do bundles increase AOV?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Color & Branding">
    **Test variations:**

    - Partner accent colors integrated
    - Full partner color takeover
    - Segment-specific palettes
    
    **Hypothesis to validate:**
    - Does partner color increase personalization feel?
    - Does full co-branding improve or hurt trust?
    - Do segment-specific colors perform differently?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Discount Presentation">
    **Test variations:**
    - Discount in hero vs. sticky bar
    - Percentage vs. dollar amount
    - Code visible vs. auto-applied
    - Urgency elements (countdown, limited)
    
    **Hypothesis to validate:**
    - Does discount prominence affect conversion?
    - Does urgency increase or decrease trust?
    - Auto-apply vs. manual: which performs better?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Running Tests

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hypothesis">
    Start with a clear hypothesis: "We believe [change] will [outcome] because [reason]."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Segment Selection">
    Decide who to test: all partners, specific segment, or random sample.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Variation Creation">
    Build the test variant. Keep changes minimal—test one variable at a time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Traffic Split">
    Route traffic appropriately: 50/50 for clear tests, smaller % for risky changes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Measurement">
    Define success metrics upfront: CVR, AOV, add-to-cart rate, bounce rate.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analysis">
    Run until statistical significance. Don't call tests too early.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mobile Optimization

Most partner traffic is mobile. Design for mobile first.

### Mobile Priorities

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Hero loads fast and displays correctly on mobile
  - [ ] Partner photo isn't cut off or stretched
  - [ ] CTAs are thumb-friendly (min 44px tap targets)
  - [ ] Product cards are easy to browse and tap
  - [ ] Discount code is visible without scrolling
  - [ ] Add-to-cart is always accessible
  - [ ] Form fields are mobile-optimized
  - [ ] Page speed < 3 seconds on 3G
</Checklist>

### Common Mobile Mistakes

<Warning>
**Mistake 1:** Hero images that crop partner's face on mobile

**Mistake 2:** Horizontal scroll on product grids

**Mistake 3:** Discount bar that covers content

**Mistake 4:** Sticky elements that take up too much screen

**Mistake 5:** Forms that require zooming to complete
</Warning>

## Personalization Levels

Not all partners need the same level of personalization:

| Level | What's Personalized | Best For |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **Basic** | Name, photo, discount code | High-volume micro-influencers |
| **Standard** | + Bio, product picks, quote | Active mid-tier partners |
| **Premium** | + UGC gallery, custom sections | Top performers |
| **Custom** | Full bespoke design | VIP/celebrity partners |

### Scaling Personalization

<Tip>
Start with Basic for all partners, then unlock higher levels based on performance or commitment. This incentivizes partners and focuses your design effort on high-value relationships.
</Tip>
