## Getting Partners In the Door

You've defined your segment strategy. Now you need to actually recruit those partners. This step is about building enrollment funnels that:

- Attract the **right** partners (not just any partners)
- Convert interest into **active participation**
- Set the stage for successful **activation**

<Info>
This guide focuses on enrollment strategy and user flows—not specific tool tutorials. CreatorCommerce's partner apps power the technical side, but the strategy principles apply regardless of your tech stack.

## The Three Enrollment Channels

Partners find you through three primary channels. Most successful programs leverage all three.

### 1. Product Seeding

**What it is:** Sending products to potential partners before they commit, creating organic evangelists.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Product Seeding Works">
    1. **Identify targets** — Use your segment strategy to build lists of potential partners
    2. **Ship product** — Send samples with personalized notes
    3. **Follow up** — Check in, ask for feedback, gauge interest
    4. **Convert** — Transition interested recipients into formal partners
    
    The key is treating seeding as a relationship-building exercise, not a transaction.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When to Use Product Seeding">
    **Ideal for:**
    - Products that "sell themselves" when experienced
    - Building relationships with hard-to-reach partners
    - Creating organic content and buzz
    - Micro-influencer programs at scale
    
    **Less effective for:**
    - High-cost products with low margin
    - Partners who receive constant gifting
    - Transactional affiliate relationships
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product Seeding Best Practices">
    - **Personalize the outreach** — Generic mass-sends get ignored
    - **Include a clear next step** — What should they do after trying the product?
    - **Don't require posting** — Let organic love develop naturally
    - **Track and follow up** — Seeding without follow-up is just free product
    - **Quality over quantity** — 50 targeted sends beat 500 spray-and-pray
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Inbound Recruitment

**What it is:** Partners coming to you through application pages, referrals, and organic discovery.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Building Inbound Funnels">
    **Dedicated partner landing pages:**
    - Clear value proposition for partners
    - Segment-specific messaging (one page for influencers, another for practitioners)
    - Simple application process
    - Social proof from existing partners
    
    **Application forms that qualify:**
    - Collect information needed for activation
    - Include questions that filter fit
    - Make it easy enough that good partners complete it
    - Hard enough that tire-kickers don't bother
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Driving Inbound Traffic">
    - **Footer links** — "Become a Partner" in your site footer
    - **Thank-you pages** — Invite customers to become affiliates post-purchase
    - **Partner referrals** — Existing partners recommend their network
    - **Social presence** — Showcase partner success to attract more
    - **SEO** — Rank for "[your category] affiliate program"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Qualifying Inbound Applicants">
    Not everyone who applies is a fit. Build qualification into your flow:
    
    | Question Type | Purpose |
    |---------------|---------|
    | Platform presence | Gauge reach and content type |
    | Audience demographics | Check alignment with your customers |
    | Past partnerships | Assess experience level |
    | Motivation | Understand why they want to partner |
    
    Segment-specific questions help route partners to the right activation path.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Outbound Outreach

**What it is:** Proactively reaching out to potential partners via email, DM, or other channels.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email Outreach">
    **The anatomy of effective partner outreach emails:**
    
    1. **Subject line** — Personal, not salesy (avoid "Partnership Opportunity!")
    2. **Opening** — Reference their specific content or work
    3. **Value prop** — What's in it for them? (not what's in it for you)
    4. **Proof** — Quick credibility (brand recognition, other partners)
    5. **Ask** — Clear, low-friction next step
    
    **Example structure:**
    ```
    Subject: Loved your post on [specific topic]
    
    Hi [Name],
    
    [Specific reference to their content that shows you actually looked]
    
    I'm with [Brand] and we're building a partner program 
    specifically for [their segment]. Our partners get 
    [key benefit], and I think you'd be a great fit because 
    [specific reason].
    
    Would you be interested in learning more? Just reply 
    and I'll send over the details.
    
    [Your name]
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="DM Outreach">
    **Platform-specific approaches:**
    
    **Instagram DMs:**
    - Keep it short (they'll see preview text)
    - Lead with genuine compliment
    - Don't pitch in first message—start a conversation
    
    **TikTok:**
    - Comment on videos first to build recognition
    - DMs should reference specific content
    - Younger creators expect more casual tone
    
    **LinkedIn:**
    - More formal approach appropriate
    - Connect first, message second
    - Emphasize professional benefits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outreach at Scale">
    **Personalization vs. volume trade-off:**
    
    | Approach | Best For |
    |----------|----------|
    | High-touch, fully personalized | Priority targets, larger creators |
    | Templated with personalization | Mid-tier, moderate volume |
    | Automated sequences | Micro-influencers at scale |
    
    The key is matching your effort level to the partner's potential value.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Enrollment Flow Design

Once a partner expresses interest, what happens next? Your enrollment flow converts interest into activated partners.

### The Enrollment Journey

```
Discovery → Application → Approval → Onboarding → Activation
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Application">
    Partner submits information through your form or responds to outreach
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Approval">
    You (or automation) qualify the partner and approve/decline
  </Step>
  <Step title="Welcome & Onboarding">
    Partner receives credentials, learns the program, and gets set up
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activation">
    Partner's co-branded experience goes live (covered in Step 2)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Segment-Specific Flows

Different segments need different enrollment experiences:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Influencer Flow">
    **Optimized for:**
    - Speed and simplicity
    - Social proof and FOMO
    - Visual, mobile-friendly forms
    
    **Key elements:**
    - Quick application (under 3 minutes)
    - Social media handle verification
    - Instant or near-instant approval for qualified applicants
    - Immediate access to assets and links
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Practitioner Flow">
    **Optimized for:**
    - Professional credibility

    - Creative asset library access
    - Analytics dashboard introduction
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Application Form Strategy

Your application form is doing three jobs:
1. **Collecting data** for activation
2. **Qualifying** applicants
3. **Setting expectations** for the program

### Essential Data Collection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contact & Identity">
    - Name (first and last)
    - Email address
    - Phone (optional, for SMS flows)
    - Shipping address (for product seeding)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Platform Presence">
    - Primary social platform
    - Handle/URL
    - Follower count (self-reported or verified)
    - Content category/niche
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Segment-Specific Fields">
    **For practitioners:**
    - Credential type
    - Practice name/location
    - Client volume
    
    **For influencers:**
    - Content style
    - Past brand partnerships
    - Rate expectations (if applicable)
    
    **For publishers:**
    - Site URL
    - Monthly traffic
    - Content focus
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Activation Preparation">
    Fields that feed directly into co-branded experiences:
    
    - Bio/description
    - Profile photo
    - Product preferences/favorites
    - Custom messaging or tagline
    
    <Tip>
    Anything you don't collect here, you can generate or request later. Don't let a long form kill your conversion rate.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Form Length Trade-offs

| Form Length | Conversion Rate | Data Quality | Activation Speed |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| Short (5-7 fields) | Higher | Lower | Requires follow-up |
| Medium (10-15 fields) | Moderate | Good | Balanced |
| Long (20+ fields) | Lower | Highest | Ready to activate |

**Recommendation:** Start with a shorter form that captures essentials, then collect additional data during onboarding or through progressive profiling.

---

## Approval Workflows

Not every applicant should become a partner. Build approval workflows that balance quality with speed.

### Approval Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-Approval">
    **How it works:**
    - Set criteria (follower thresholds, verified platforms, etc.)
    - Automatically approve applicants who meet criteria
    - Flag edge cases for manual review
    
    **Best for:**
    - Micro-influencer programs at scale
    - Low-risk, high-volume partnerships
    
    **Risk:**
    - Lower quality control
    - Potential brand safety issues
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Review">
    **How it works:**
    - Every application reviewed by a human
    - Checklist-based evaluation
    - Personalized accept/decline messages
    
    **Best for:**
    - Smaller, curated programs
    - Professional/practitioner partnerships
    - Brand-sensitive categories
    
    **Risk:**
    - Slower enrollment
    - Scalability bottleneck
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    **How it works:**
    - Auto-approve clear fits
    - Auto-decline clear non-fits
    - Queue borderline cases for manual review
    
    **Best for:**
    - Programs at moderate scale
    - Balancing quality and speed
    
    **Implementation:**
    Use scoring or rules to categorize applicants:
    - Score > X → Auto-approve
    - Score < Y → Auto-decline
    - Score between Y and X → Manual review
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Post-Enrollment Onboarding

Enrollment doesn't end at approval. Partners need onboarding that prepares them for activation.

### Onboarding Essentials

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Welcome email with immediate value (not just "you're approved!")
  - [ ] Access to partner portal/dashboard
  - [ ] Clear next steps for getting started
  - [ ] Product education (what are they promoting?)
  - [ ] Program details (commission, rules, expectations)
  - [ ] Support resources (who to contact, FAQ)
</Checklist>

### Onboarding by Segment

| Segment | Onboarding Priority | Key Resources |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|
| Influencer | Speed to first post | Creative assets, captions, story templates |
| Practitioner | Product knowledge | Clinical studies, protocols, patient materials |
| Publisher | Technical integration | Tracking links, widgets, API access |

---

## Measuring Enrollment Success

Track these metrics to optimize your enrollment funnel:

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Application volume | Top of funnel interest | Depends on outreach |
| Application completion rate | Form friction | >60% |
| Approval rate | Applicant quality | 40-80% (varies by selectivity) |
| Time to approval | Process efficiency | <48 hours |
| Activation rate | Enrollment → Active | >50% |

<Warning>
The most important metric is **activation rate**—the percentage of approved partners who actually start promoting. Enrollment means nothing if partners don't activate.
</Warning>

---

## What's Next

You're enrolling partners. Now it's time to activate them—to turn approved partners into excited, productive promoters through co-branding.
