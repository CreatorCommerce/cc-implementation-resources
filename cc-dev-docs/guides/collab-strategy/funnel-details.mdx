title: 'The Full Shopping Journey'
description: 'Go beyond the landing page with co-branded pop-ups, product pages, carts, and every touchpoint in the shopping experience.'

## Beyond the Landing Page

A great landing page gets the click. But conversion happens across the entire shopping journey.

This step is about extending co-branding beyond the landing page—into every touchpoint where partner context can increase trust and conversion:

- **Pop-ups and modals**
- **Product pages**
- **Cart and checkout**
- **Post-purchase flows**

Every moment is an opportunity to reinforce: "You're shopping with [Partner]."

## The Full Co-branded Funnel

```
Landing Page → Product Page → Cart → Checkout → Thank You → Email
      ↑                              ↑                        ↑
   Pop-ups                    Discount Applied          Co-branded Email
```

Let's break down each touchpoint.

### Pop-up Best Practices for CC Funnels

<Tip>
**Block competing pop-ups:** When a visitor arrives via partner link, disable your regular site pop-ups. The partner funnel IS the pop-up experience. Conflicting pop-ups confuse visitors and dilute the co-branded message.
</Tip>

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Partner context carried into pop-up
  - [ ] Discount code displayed or auto-applied
  - [ ] Mobile-friendly sizing and interactions
  - [ ] Easy close (X button clearly visible)
  - [ ] Frequency capping (don't show same pop-up repeatedly)
  - [ ] A/B test pop-up vs. no pop-up
</Checklist>

## Co-branded Product Pages

When visitors click through to product pages, maintain the partner context:

### Product Page Co-branding Elements

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Above the Fold">
    **Partner endorsement banner:**
    - "Recommended by [Partner Name]"
    - Partner thumbnail photo
    - Link back to partner's landing page
    
    **Discount reminder:**
    - Partner's discount code displayed
    - "Your discount will be applied at checkout"
    - Compare price (crossed out original)
    
    **Placement:** Sticky header or inline below product title
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Product Details">
    **Partner testimonial:**
    - Partner's quote about this specific product
    - Star rating or recommendation badge
    - "Why [Partner] loves this"
    
    **Partner-specific content:**
    - Usage tips from the partner
    - Partner's photos with product
    - Partner's routine/protocol featuring product
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Social Proof">
    **UGC integration:**

{% assign cc_creator = metaobjects.creator[cc_handle] %}

{% if cc_creator %}
  <div class="cc-partner-endorsement">
    <img src="{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture }}" 
         alt="{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}" />
    <span>Recommended by {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}</span>
    <span class="cc-discount">Use code: {{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-code }}</span>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

## Co-branded Cart

The cart is a critical conversion moment. Reinforce partner context:

### Cart Co-branding Elements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cart Header">
    - "Your cart with [Partner]'s picks"
    - Partner photo thumbnail
    - Discount status confirmation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Discount Application">
    - Discount code pre-filled or auto-applied
    - Savings amount displayed
    - "Thanks to [Partner], you're saving $X"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Partner Upsells">
    - "Complete your routine with [Partner]'s other picks"
    - Cross-sell products from partner's recommendations
    - Bundle suggestions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Trust Reinforcement">
    - Partner testimonial sidebar
    - "X people bought this with [Partner]"
    - Shipping and guarantee reminders
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Auto-Apply vs. Manual Discount

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auto-Apply">
    **How it works:**
    - Discount code stored in cart attributes
    - Applied automatically at checkout
    - Visitor sees discounted prices throughout
    
    **Pros:**
    - Seamless experience
    - Higher conversion (no friction)
    - Price comparison built-in
    
    **Cons:**
    - Less "reveal" moment
    - May reduce perceived value of discount
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Entry">
    **How it works:**
    - Discount code displayed prominently
    - Visitor enters at checkout
    - "Aha" moment when applied
    
    **Pros:**
    - Partner code feels like a gift
    - Clear attribution to partner
    - Works with all checkout types
    
    **Cons:**
    - Friction in checkout
    - Risk of forgetting or mistyping
    - Potential abandonment
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hybrid Approach">
    **How it works:**
    - Code displayed throughout funnel
    - Auto-applied at checkout (if possible)
    - Fallback to manual if auto-apply fails
    
    **Implementation:**
    - Use cart attributes to pass code
    - Checkout script applies automatically
    - Show code as backup option
    
    **This is the recommended approach.**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Checkout Co-branding

Shopify checkout has limitations, but you can still reinforce partner context:

### What's Possible

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Checkout UI Extensions">
    **Available with Shopify Plus or Checkout Extensibility:**
    - Custom banners in checkout
    - Partner branding elements
    - Discount confirmation messaging

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Standard Checkout">
    **What you can do:**

    - Thank-you page redirect to co-branded page
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Can't add partner photos or custom elements
    - Limited branding control
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Attribution Tracking

Ensure every order from a partner funnel is properly attributed:

```liquid
{% comment %} Set cart attributes for tracking {% endcomment %}
<input type="hidden" name="attributes[cc-creator-handle]" value="{{ cc_creator.handle }}" />
<input type="hidden" name="attributes[cc-collab-id]" value="{{ cc_creator.cc-collab-id }}" />
<input type="hidden" name="attributes[cc-discount-code]" value="{{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-code }}" />
```

## Post-Purchase Co-branding

The sale isn't the end—it's the beginning of the relationship:

### Thank-You Page

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Partner Appreciation">
    - "Thanks for shopping with [Partner]!"
    - Partner photo and message
    - Reminder of their ongoing relationship with brand
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Social Sharing">

    - Pre-filled social share buttons
    - Incentive for sharing (future discount)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cross-sell">
    - "Other picks from [Partner]"
    - Products they might have missed
    - Future purchase incentive
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Community Invitation">
    - Follow [Partner] on social
    - Join brand community
    - Sign up for partner's content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Order Confirmation Email

<Checklist>

  - [ ] Partner photo in email header
  - [ ] "You shopped with [Partner]" messaging
  - [ ] Partner's discount for next purchase
  - [ ] Social links to partner
  - [ ] UGC request tied to partner
</Checklist>

## Content Utilization

Use the content you've collected throughout the funnel:

### Where Content Appears

| Content Type | Landing Page | Pop-ups | Product Pages | Cart | Emails |
|--------------|--------------|---------|---------------|------|--------|
| Partner photo | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Partner bio | ✓ |  |  |  | ✓ |
| Partner quote | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| UGC gallery | ✓ |  | ✓ |  |  |
| Product picks | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Discount code | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom fields (collab) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| Custom fields (drop) | ✓ |  |  |  |  |
| Custom fields (product) | ✓ |  | ✓ |  |  |

### Dynamic Text Tokens

Use tokens to personalize messaging at scale:

```liquid
{% comment %} Available tokens in CC templates {% endcomment %}
[cc-creator-first-name]     → "Sarah"
[cc-creator-discount-code]  → "SARAH15"
[cc-creator-discount-amount]→ "15%"
[cc-creator-shop-tagline]   → "Clean beauty picks"
```

#### Custom Field Tokens

Beyond built-in tokens, [custom fields](/references/custom-fields-reference) collected via [forms](/guides/creator-experience/forms/overview) can also appear throughout the funnel:

- **Collab-level fields** (e.g., creator specialty, credentials) → Available everywhere the creator context exists
- **Drop-level fields** (e.g., drop tagline, seasonal theme) → Available when iterating through drops
- **Product-level fields** (e.g., "Why I love this," sizing notes) → Available within product loops inside drops

Custom field data flows automatically from forms into the creator metaobject, so it can be displayed on landing pages, product pages, pop-ups, or even in co-branded emails.

## Funnel Consistency

Maintain visual and messaging consistency across all touchpoints:

### Consistency Checklist

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Partner name spelled/displayed consistently
  - [ ] Same photo used across touchpoints
  - [ ] Discount code matches everywhere
  - [ ] Color accents (if used) are consistent
  - [ ] Messaging tone matches partner's voice
  - [ ] CTAs use consistent language
  - [ ] Mobile experience matches desktop
</Checklist>

### Common Inconsistencies to Avoid

<Warning>
**Mistake 1:** Different partner photos on landing page vs. emails

**Mistake 2:** Discount code displayed differently (15% vs $15 off)

**Mistake 3:** Partner name in hero but not in cart

**Mistake 4:** Forgetting partner context on product pages

**Mistake 5:** Generic checkout with no partner messaging
</Warning>
