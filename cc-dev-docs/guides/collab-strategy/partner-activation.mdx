## From Enrolled to Excited

A partner signed up. Now what?

**Activation** is the critical moment where you transform an approved partner into an engaged promoter. This is where CreatorCommerce's core value shines—creating personalized, co-branded experiences that make partners feel like true collaborators, not just another affiliate.

The goal of activation is **shock and awe**: show partners something so impressive, so personalized, that they can't wait to share it.

## The Activation Framework

Activation has four components:

## 1. Data Collection

### What You Need for Personalization

The co-branded experience is only as good as the data behind it. You need:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identity Data">

## 2. Automated Page Generation

### The Magic Moment

The "shock and awe" comes when a partner sees their personalized page for the first time. This should happen automatically—or as close to automatically as possible.

**The flow:**
1. Partner is approved
2. System gathers/generates initial data
3. Co-branded page is created automatically
4. Partner is notified to view and customize

### AI + Automation Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Template Selection">
    Based on partner segment, select the appropriate co-branded template:
    - Influencer → Visual-first, UGC-heavy template
    - Practitioner → Professional, clinical template
    - Publisher → Content-focused, editorial template
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Population">
    Fill template with available data:
    - Partner name, photo, bio
    - Product recommendations (from preferences or AI)
    - Discount code and commission info
    - Dynamic text tokens for personalization
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="AI Enhancement">
    For missing or partial data, use AI to:
    - Generate bio text from social profile
    - Write personalized product descriptions
    - Create section headings in partner's voice
    - Suggest product selections based on audience
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quality Moderation">
    Before publishing, either:
    - Auto-publish with partner editing capability
    - Queue for human review (for premium partners)
    - Send to partner for approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Templates by Segment

| Segment | Template Focus | Key Elements |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Influencer | Visual, lifestyle | Large hero image, UGC grid, style picks |
| Practitioner | Professional, clinical | Credentials, patient resources, protocols |
| Affiliate | Performance, conversion | Clear CTAs, discount emphasis, product focus |
| Publisher | Editorial, content | Article integration, embedded products |

## 3. Partner Notification

### Driving to the "Wow" Moment

You've created something amazing. Now make sure they see it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email Notification">
    **The reveal email:**
    
    - Subject: Personal, exciting (not transactional)
    - Hero: Screenshot or preview of their page
    - CTA: "View Your Page" (primary) + "Customize" (secondary)
    - Social proof: "Join X partners already earning"
    
    **Timing:** Send immediately upon page creation, or next morning if overnight
    
    **Example subject lines:**
    - "Your [Brand] page is live 🎉"
    - "[Partner Name], your storefront is ready"
    - "We built this for you—come see"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SMS Notification">
    **When to use:** For time-sensitive or high-priority partners
    
    **Keep it short:**
    ```
    Hey [Name]! Your [Brand] page is live 🙌 
    Check it out: [link]
    ```
    
    **Considerations:**
    - Only if partner opted in to SMS
    - Reserve for key moments, don't overuse
    - Include direct link to their page
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="In-App/Dashboard Notification">
    **For partners in your portal:**
    - Prominent "Your page is ready" banner
    - Guided tour on first visit
    - Preview with "Edit" and "Share" buttons
    
    **Make it discoverable:**
    - Don't bury it in navigation
    - Use visual callouts
    - Consider modal on first login
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Activation Flows

Build automated flows that nurture partners to activation:

```
Day 0: Page created → Email: "Your page is live!"
Day 2: If not viewed → Email: "You haven't seen your page yet"
Day 5: If viewed, not shared → Email: "Here's how to start earning"
Day 7: If no activity → Email: "Quick wins to get started"
```

<Tip>
The goal is activation, not annoyance. Track engagement and stop flows when partners become active—or when they're clearly not interested.
</Tip>

## Whitelisted Meta Ads Strategy

For qualified partners, offer 1-click ad authorization to run whitelisted Meta ads:

### What It Is

Partners authorize your brand to run ads from their accounts—combining your creative/budget with their audience credibility.

### Why Partners Love It

- **No effort required** — You handle everything
- **Looks like their content** — Appears from their account
- **Revenue potential** — They earn when ads convert
- **Builds their brand** — Professional, polished campaigns

### Implementation

1. **Eligibility criteria** — Define which partners qualify
2. **Authorization flow** — 1-click Meta Business authorization
3. **Creative process** — You create (often using their UGC)
4. **Revenue share** — Clear terms on ad-driven conversions
5. **Performance reporting** — Keep partners informed

<Info>
Whitelisted ads often perform 2-3x better than traditional ads because they inherit the trust and engagement of the creator's account.
</Info>

## Moderation at Scale

With automation comes the need for moderation:

### Moderation Strategy

| Content Type | Moderation Approach |
|--------------|---------------------|
| AI-generated bios | Light review, partner can edit |
| Partner-submitted photos | Manual review before publish |
| Product selections | Auto-approve from catalog |
| UGC for ads | Full review required |

### Admin Tools

Build (or use) moderation tools that enable:
- Bulk review queues
- Quick approve/reject actions
- Edit-in-place for quick fixes
- Escalation for edge cases
- Audit trails for compliance

## Measuring Activation Success

| Metric | What It Measures | Target |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| Time to activation | Enrollment → First share | &lt;72 hours |
| Page view rate | Partners who view their page | >80% |
| Customization rate | Partners who edit their page | >30% |
| Share rate | Partners who share their link | >50% |
| First sale rate | Partners who generate a sale | >20% |

<Warning>
**The most important metric:** Share rate. A partner who never shares their page might as well not exist. Focus your activation efforts on getting that first share.
</Warning>

---

## What's Next

Partners are activated and sharing. Now let's design the storefronts they're sharing—co-branded experiences that convert.
