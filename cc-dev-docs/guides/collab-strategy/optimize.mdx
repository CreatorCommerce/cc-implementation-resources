## Funnel Testing

### Testing Philosophy

Don't guess—test. Every funnel decision should be validated with data.

<Tip>
**Start with high-impact tests.** A 10% improvement on your hero section affects everyone. A 10% improvement on an obscure element affects few.
</Tip>

### Testing Priorities

Test in order of impact:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hero Section">
    The first thing visitors see. Test:
    - Partner photo size and placement
    - Headline messaging
    - CTA copy and placement
    - Discount presentation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Product Section">
    Where purchase intent forms. Test:
    - Number of products shown
    - Product selection strategy
    - Grid vs. carousel
    - Quick-add vs. click-through
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Social Proof">
    Trust-building elements. Test:
    - Testimonial placement
    - UGC integration
    - Review display
    - Partner credibility indicators
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cart & Checkout">
    Conversion finalization. Test:
    - Cart upsells
    - Discount application method
    - Checkout messaging
    - Payment option presentation
  </Step>
</Steps>
