title: 'Step 7: Advanced Strategies'
description: 'For professional and publisher partners: 100% co-branded whitelabel sites and product embeds on their existing sites.'
---

## Beyond Standard Co-branding

For most partners, the standard co-branded funnel is perfect. But some partners need more:

- **Professional practitioners** with their own patient portals
- **Publishers** who want products embedded in their content
- **Large influencers** who want their own "brand within a brand"
- **Business partners** who need wholesale or B2B experiences

This step covers advanced strategies for these high-value relationships.

---

## Whitelabel Sites

### What It Means

A **whitelabel site** is a fully co-branded shopping experience that feels like the partner's own store:

- Partner's branding dominates (or exclusive)
- Full product catalog or curated selection
- Partner-managed content and merchandising
- Your fulfillment and backend

### When to Offer Whitelabel

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Candidates">
    - Partners driving significant volume (top 1-5%)
    - Practitioners with established patient bases
    - Publishers with high-intent traffic
    - Business partners or wholesalers
    - Long-term strategic relationships
    
    **Key signal:** Partner is asking for more control and customization
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not Ready Yet">
    - Partners without proven track record
    - Low-volume partners (not worth the investment)
    - Partners who don't have their own brand identity

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Not a Fit">
    - Social-first influencers (no website)

## B2B and Wholesale Considerations

### When Partners Are Businesses

Some "partners" are actually businesses that need:

- **Volume pricing** — Tiered discounts for quantity

## Managing Advanced Relationships

Advanced partnerships require more management:

### Tiered Partnership Structure

| Tier | Access Level | Support Level |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Standard | Co-branded page | Self-service |
| Premium | Premium templates, features | Priority support |
| Enterprise | Whitelabel, custom integration | Dedicated manager |

### Enterprise Partner Management

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Dedicated account manager assigned
  - [ ] Quarterly business reviews scheduled
  - [ ] Custom SLA and support channels
  - [ ] Revenue share and terms documented
  - [ ] Technical integration support
  - [ ] Co-marketing opportunities explored
</Checklist>

---

## ROI Considerations

Advanced strategies require more investment. Ensure the math works:

### Whitelabel ROI

| Investment | Cost |
|------------|------|
| Custom design/development | $X one-time |
| Ongoing maintenance | $Y/month |
| Partner management | Z hours/month |

| Return | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Partner revenue | $A/month |
| LTV of partner-acquired customers | $B |
| Strategic value (exclusivity, market access) | Hard to quantify |

**Rule of thumb:** Whitelabel should be reserved for partners generating 10x+ the cost in revenue.

### Embed ROI

| Investment | Cost |
|------------|------|
| Widget development | $X one-time |
| Maintenance | $Y/month |
| Partner support | Z hours/month |

| Return | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue from embeds | $A/month |
| New customer acquisition | $B |
| SEO/traffic benefit | Indirect |
