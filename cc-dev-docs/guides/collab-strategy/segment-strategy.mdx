## The Foundation of Everything

Before you build funnels, recruit partners, or design landing pages—you need to know **who you're building for**.

Segment strategy isn't just "we want influencers." It's understanding:
- Which partner types drive revenue for your product category
- How different segments require different activation approaches  
- Where to focus limited resources for maximum impact

This step is **Step 0** because it's the foundation. Get this wrong, and everything downstream suffers.

## Building Your Segment Matrix

Use this framework to define your strategy:

### Step 1: List Your Potential Segments

Based on your product category, which partner types could theoretically work?

### Step 2: Score Each Segment

For each segment, rate 1-5:

| Criteria | Questions to Ask |
|----------|------------------|
| **Audience Fit** | Does this segment's audience match your target customer? |
| **Credibility Impact** | How much does this segment's endorsement matter? |
| **Accessibility** | How easy is it to recruit and activate this segment? |
| **Scalability** | Can you build a large program with this segment? |
| **Content Value** | Will this segment create valuable UGC and social proof? |

### Step 3: Prioritize

Focus your initial strategy on 2-3 segments. You can expand later, but trying to serve everyone from day one dilutes your efforts.

### Step 4: Define Segment-Specific Approaches

Each priority segment needs its own:
- Recruitment messaging
- Activation flow
- Co-branded experience design
- Success metrics

## Common Segmentation Mistakes

<Warning>
**Mistake 1: "We want all influencers"**

Influencers aren't a single segment. A beauty micro-influencer and a tech macro-influencer require completely different approaches. Be specific.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 2: Ignoring professionals**

For many product categories, practitioners and professionals drive more revenue per partner than influencers. Don't overlook them because they're less "glamorous."
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 3: Chasing follower counts**

A micro-influencer with 10K highly-engaged followers in your exact niche often outperforms a 500K creator with a general audience. Match the audience, not the number.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 4: One-size-fits-all activation**

Different segments need different experiences. A practitioner wants clinical resources; an influencer wants Instagram-ready assets. Plan for this from the start.
</Warning>

---

## Applying This Across Markets

If you operate in multiple markets (geographic or demographic), apply this segmentation thinking to each:

- Which segments exist in each market?
- Do segment priorities differ by market?
- Are there market-specific partner types to consider?

The framework is the same, but the specific segments and priorities may vary.
