## Funnel Deployment

### Deploying Behind Existing Links

If partners already have affiliate links, you can upgrade them to co-branded funnels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Map Existing Partners">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create CC Profiles">
    Create CreatorCommerce records for each partner (can be automated)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate CC Links">
    Each partner gets a co-branded URL (e.g., `/pages/creators/partner-handle`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Link Destinations">
    Option A: Update affiliate links to point to CC pages
    Option B: Use redirect rules to route traffic
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Tracking">
    Ensure affiliate commission tracking still works with new flow
  </Step>
</Steps>
