## Why Creator Messaging Matters

Creators who feel informed and supported perform better. The difference between a creator who shares once and forgets and one who consistently drives revenue is often just communication.

| Communication Level | Creator Behavior | Revenue Impact |
|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| No communication | Shares once, forgets | Minimal |
| Basic onboarding only | Posts a few times, fades | Low |
| Regular updates + nudges | Stays active, optimizes | Moderate |
| Personalized engagement | Invests in the relationship, creates more | High |

## Message Categories

### Transactional Messages
Triggered automatically by creator actions:

- **Welcome** -- Immediately after enrollment
- **Order attributed** -- When a sale is tracked to the creator
- **Commission earned** -- Payout notifications
- **Content approved** -- After form submissions are reviewed
- **Milestone hit** -- Sales thresholds, tier upgrades

### Lifecycle Messages
Based on where the creator is in their journey:

- **Onboarding sequence** -- First 7 days: setup, first share, tips
- **Activation nudges** -- If inactive after 14 days
- **Performance updates** -- Weekly or monthly recaps
- **Re-engagement** -- For creators who've gone quiet
- **Anniversary/milestone** -- Celebrate tenure and results

### Campaign Messages
Coordinated sends to creator segments:

- **Product launch announcements** -- New products to promote
- **Seasonal campaigns** -- Holiday pushes, back-to-school, etc.
- **Content requests** -- Ask for UGC, reviews, or specific content
- **Exclusive offers** -- Early access, higher commission periods

## Channels

| Channel | Best For | Timing |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Email** | Detailed updates, onboarding sequences, campaign briefs | Non-urgent, detailed |
| **SMS** | Quick wins, urgent updates, milestone celebrations | Time-sensitive |
| **In-app** | Dashboard notifications, task reminders | When creator is active |
