## Beyond Basic Discount Codes

A simple "PARTNER15" code is just the beginning. Strategic discount structures can:

- **Incentivize higher-value partners** with better rates
- **Increase AOV** with threshold-based discounts
- **Drive urgency** with time-limited offers
- **Improve attribution** with unique per-partner codes
- **Enable A/B testing** of discount strategies

## Discount Structures

### Flat Percentage

The simplest approach—every partner gets the same discount.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Easy to manage | No differentiation |
| Clear to partners | No incentive to perform |
| Simple attribution | May leave money on table |

**Best for:** Starting out, simple programs

### Tiered by Partner Level

Different discounts based on partner performance or tier.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure">
    | Tier | Criteria | Discount |
    |------|----------|----------|
    | Bronze | New partners | 10% |
    | Silver | 10+ sales | 15% |
    | Gold | 50+ sales | 20% |
    | Platinum | 200+ sales | 25% |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Implementation">
    **In CreatorCommerce:**
    - Set tier in partner profile
    - Assign discount code based on tier
    - Update automatically when thresholds hit
    
    **In Shopify:**
    - Create discount code per tier
    - Or use dynamic pricing app
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Communication">
    Show partners their progress:
    - Current tier and discount
    - Sales to next tier
    - Benefits of upgrading
    - Leaderboard (optional)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Threshold-Based (Spend More, Save More)

Discount increases with cart value.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Structure">
    | Cart Value | Discount |
    |------------|----------|
    | $50+ | 10% off |
    | $100+ | 15% off |
    | $150+ | 20% off |
    | $200+ | 25% off |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Why It Works">
    - Increases AOV significantly
    - Customers feel rewarded for buying more
    - Higher absolute savings = higher perceived value
    - Works well with partner recommendation bundles
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Implementation">
    Use Shopify's automatic discounts with minimum purchase requirements, or use apps for more complex logic.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Product-Specific Discounts

Different discounts for different products or categories.

**Use cases:**
- Higher margins on some products → deeper discount
- New product launches → promotional discount
- Clearance items → extra discount
- Bundles → special pricing

### Stackable Discounts

Allow partner discount to stack with other offers.

<Warning>
Be careful with stacking—it can erode margins quickly. Set clear rules about what stacks.
</Warning>

| Stacks With | Doesn't Stack With |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Free shipping thresholds | Other discount codes |
| Automatic sale pricing | BOGO offers |
| Loyalty points | Clearance pricing |

---

## Unique Per-Partner Codes

### Why Unique Codes Matter

| Shared Code (PARTNER15) | Unique Code (SARAH15) |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Easy to set up | Clear attribution |
| Hard to track who drove sale | Partner feels ownership |
| Can be shared/leaked | Easier leak detection |
| No personalization | Brandable for partner |

### Generating Unique Codes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual">
    Create codes one-by-one in Shopify admin.
    
    **Naming convention:** `[PARTNERNAME][DISCOUNT]`
    - SARAH15
    - DRJONES20
    - FITNESSMOM10
    
    **Best for:** Small programs (&lt;50 partners)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bulk via CSV">
    Generate codes in spreadsheet, import to Shopify.
    
    **Best for:** Medium programs, periodic updates
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Automated via API">
    Use Shopify API or apps to create codes automatically when partners join.
    
    **Best for:** Large programs, automated onboarding
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CreatorCommerce">
    Codes synced automatically with partner profiles.
    
    **Best for:** Full CC implementation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Automatic Discount Application

### URL-Based Auto-Apply

Apply discount automatically when customer arrives via partner link.

**How it works:**
```
yourstore.com/discount/SARAH15?redirect=/pages/creators/sarah
```

Customer lands on Sarah's page with discount already applied.

### Cart Attribute Method

Store discount in cart attributes, apply at checkout.

```liquid
{% if cart.attributes['cc-discount-code'] %}
  <!-- Discount code pre-populated -->
  <input type="hidden" name="discount" value="{{ cart.attributes['cc-discount-code'] }}">
{% endif %}
```

### Automatic Discounts (Shopify)

Use Shopify's automatic discounts feature:
- Discount applies automatically when conditions met
- No code entry required
- Combine with partner attribution via cart attributes

---

## Strategic Discount Tactics

### First-Time Customer Bonus

Extra discount for first-time buyers through partner links.

```
Regular partner discount: 15%
First-time buyer bonus: +5%
Total for new customers: 20%
```

**Implementation:** Use customer tags to identify new vs. returning.

### Limited-Time Boosts

Temporary discount increases for campaigns.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flash Sales">
    **Duration:** 24-48 hours
    **Boost:** +5-10%
    **Communication:** Email partners 24hrs before, give them exclusive heads up
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Seasonal Campaigns">
    **Duration:** 1-2 weeks
    **Boost:** +5%
    **Communication:** Marketing materials, social assets

    **Boost:** Special offer for their audience
    **Communication:** Personal outreach to partner
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Bundle Discounts

Special pricing when buying partner-curated bundles.

| Individual Products | Bundle Price | Savings |
|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| $30 + $25 + $20 = $75 | $60 | 20% |

**Why bundles work:**
- Higher AOV
- Partner can curate meaningful combinations
- Perceived value is high
- Simplifies purchase decision

## Tracking & Analytics

### Metrics to Monitor

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|

| Code leakage | Is code spreading beyond partner? |
| Discount impact on AOV | Does discount drive larger orders? |
| Partner tier distribution | Are partners progressing? |
| Margin by partner | Which partners are most profitable? |

### Detecting Code Leakage

Signs a code has leaked:

- Social media mentions without partner involvement
- Coupon site appearances

**Response:**
1. Rotate the code
2. Investigate source
3. Consider per-use limits
4. Communicate with partner
