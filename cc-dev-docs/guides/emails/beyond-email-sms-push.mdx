## It's All the Same

The co-branding pattern works across channels:

1. Capture creator context
2. Store on customer profile
3. Personalize outbound messages

## SMS Co-branding

### Attentive / Postscript

Same profile properties, different template syntax:

```
Hey {{ first_name }}! {{ cc_creator_name }} wanted you to know: 
your code {{ cc_discount_code }} expires tonight. 
Shop now: {{ cc_landing_url }}
```

### Key Considerations

- **Character limits** — Keep creator name short
- **Link tracking** — Ensure attribution persists
- **Frequency** — Don't over-message creator segments

## Push Notifications

### Web Push

```javascript
// Personalized push
const payload = {
  title: `${ccCreatorName} has new picks!`,
  body: `Use ${ccDiscountCode} for ${ccDiscountAmount}% off`,
  icon: ccCreatorImage,
  url: ccLandingUrl
};
```

### Mobile Push

Same profile properties synced to your mobile app's user record.

## Channel Strategy

| Channel | Best For | Creator Element |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| **Email** | Rich content, visuals | Full co-branded blocks |
| **SMS** | Urgency, reminders | Name + code |
| **Push** | Re-engagement | Name + offer |
| **In-app** | Active users | Full personalization |

## Unified Profile

The key is a unified customer profile with creator context. Once set, use across all channels:

```
Customer Profile
├── Email: sarah@example.com
├── Phone: +1234567890
├── Push token: abc123
└── CC Context:
    ├── cc_creator_handle: sarah-jones
    ├── cc_creator_name: Sarah
    ├── cc_discount_code: SARAH15
    └── cc_discount_amount: 15
```

## Same Principles

- Always include fallbacks
- Test both states
- Track performance by channel
- Respect frequency caps
