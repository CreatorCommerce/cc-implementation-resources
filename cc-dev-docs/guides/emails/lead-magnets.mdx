Use co-branded lead magnets to collect email in creator context, then deliver a creator-personalized reward.  
For implementation, setup patterns, and popup UX tactics, see [Co-branded Pop-ups](/guides/storefronts/co-branded-popups).

## Simple Examples

- "Get Sam's skincare routine"
- "Get John's discount emailed to you"

These can gate content, or reward opt-in with a creator-specific offer.

## Content Gating Patterns

- **Generic reward with creator personalization**: Use the same asset for everyone, but personalize copy with creator name.
- **Creator-specific content from custom fields**: Store creator content in a custom field (for example `cc-cookie-recipe`) and only show/deliver that asset when the field has content.

## Next Step

Go to [Co-branded Pop-ups](/guides/storefronts/co-branded-popups) to implement this end-to-end.
