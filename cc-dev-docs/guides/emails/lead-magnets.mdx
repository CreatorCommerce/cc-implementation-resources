Lead magnets are powerful tools for list building. When co-branded with partners, they become even more effective by leveraging the partner's authority and audience trust.

## What Makes Co-branded Lead Magnets Different

Traditional lead magnets offer generic value. Co-branded lead magnets:

- **Leverage partner credibility** — "Download {{ partner_name }}'s favorite picks"
- **Feel exclusive** — Content curated specifically by someone they follow
- **Drive higher opt-in rates** — Personal recommendations convert better than generic offers
- **Enable segmentation** — Know which partner drove each subscriber

## Pop-up Personalization

When visitors arrive via a partner link, your pop-ups can dynamically feature:

- Partner's name and photo
- Partner-specific discount code
- Copy that references the partner's recommendation
- Partner's quote about the product or brand

## Implementation Flow

1. **Capture with context** — Use CC-enabled pop-ups that capture partner attribution
2. **Sync to ESP** — CreatorCommerce sends partner data to Klaviyo/Attentive
3. **Segment subscribers** — Create segments based on referring partner
4. **Personalize welcome flow** — Use partner variables in your welcome series

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics for co-branded lead magnets:
- Opt-in rate by partner
- Welcome flow engagement by partner segment
- Time to first purchase by partner source
- Lifetime value by partner attribution

See [Co-branded Pop-ups](/guides/storefronts/co-branded-popups) for implementation details on the storefront side.
