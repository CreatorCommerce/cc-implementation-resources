## The Approach

Don't create separate flows for creator traffic. Add conditional blocks to existing flows.

## Flow-by-Flow Guide

### Welcome Series

**Email 1: Welcome**
```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <p>Welcome! You found us through {{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }}.</p>
  <p>Your exclusive code: <strong>{{ person|lookup:"cc-collab-discount-code" }}</strong></p>
{% else %}
  <p>Welcome to {{ organization.name }}!</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Cart Abandonment

**Email 1: Reminder (4 hours)**
```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <h2>{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }} picked these for you</h2>
  <p>Don't forget your {{ person|lookup:"cc-collab-discount-amount" }}% off!</p>
{% else %}
  <h2>You left something behind</h2>
{% endif %}
```

### Post-Purchase

**Email 1: Thank You**
```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <div class="creator-thanks">
    <img src="{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-profile-picture" }}" />
    <p>Thanks for shopping with {{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }}!</p>
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

### Browse Abandonment

```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <p>{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }} thinks you'd love these:</p>
{% else %}
  <p>Still thinking about these?</p>
{% endif %}
```

### Win-Back

```html
{% if person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" %}
  <h2>{{ person|lookup:"cc-creator-first-name" }} has new picks for you</h2>
  <p>Your code {{ person|lookup:"cc-collab-discount-code" }} is still active!</p>
{% else %}
  <h2>We miss you!</h2>
{% endif %}
```

## Block Placement

Add creator blocks at high-impact positions:
1. **Hero area** — First thing they see
2. **Before CTA** — Reinforce the discount
3. **Footer** — Reminder of the relationship

## Keep Generic Fallbacks

Every co-branded block needs a fallback. Not all customers will have creator context.

## Conditional Logic Example (Klaviyo)

Use Klaviyo conditionals to branch content by profile properties:

```html
{% if person|lookup:"Loyalty Points" > 150 %}
Hey VIP! You’ve always got free shipping & free returns

{% elif person|lookup:"Loyalty Points" > 0 %}
You have {{ person|lookup:"Loyalty Points" }} points, and you just need 150 to become a VIP!

{% else %}
Have you heard about our VIP program? Join today on our website to start earning rewards.
{% endif %}
```
