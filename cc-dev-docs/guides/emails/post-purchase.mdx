Post-purchase emails are your opportunity to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers. Co-branding these flows maintains the partner connection and opens doors for ongoing engagement.

## The Post-Purchase Opportunity

Customers who purchased through a partner already trust that relationship. Use post-purchase flows to:

- **Thank them with partner context** — Acknowledge both the purchase and the partner relationship
- **Drive repeat purchases** — Offer exclusive partner deals for their next order
- **Build community** — Connect customers with the partner's content and social channels
- **Gather reviews** — Request reviews that reference the partner's recommendation

## Retention Strategies

### Welcome Series Extension

After the initial purchase, continue the partner narrative:
1. Day 1: Thank you + partner feature
2. Day 3: Usage tips from the partner
3. Day 7: Partner's other recommendations
4. Day 14: Exclusive partner-only offer

### VIP Recognition

For customers who purchase through partners multiple times, consider:
- Special partner ambassador status
- Early access to new products the partner recommends
- Exclusive bundles curated by the partner

## Implementation

Configure these flows in Klaviyo or Attentive using CreatorCommerce profile properties. See [Enable Connections](/guides/emails/enable-connections) to get started.
