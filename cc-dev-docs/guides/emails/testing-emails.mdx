## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Creator data syncs to profiles
- [ ] Dynamic content renders correctly
- [ ] Fallbacks work when no creator context
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Links include correct attribution
- [ ] Flows trigger at right moments

## Step 1: Seed a Test Profile

Visit a creator landing page while identified:

```javascript
// In browser console on creator page
_learnq.push(['identify', { '$email': 'test@yourdomain.com' }]);
```

## Step 2: Verify Profile Properties

In Klaviyo:
1. Go to Profiles
2. Search for your test email
3. Check Custom Properties section
4. Confirm `cc_creator_*` properties exist

## Step 3: Preview Emails

In your email platform:
1. Open the email template
2. Select your test profile for preview
3. Verify dynamic content renders
4. Check both creator and non-creator states

## Step 4: Test Flow Triggers

Trigger the flow manually or via test events:

| Flow | How to Trigger |
|------|----------------|
| Cart abandonment | Add to cart, wait |
| Post-purchase | Place test order |
| Welcome | Subscribe via form |
| Browse abandonment | View products, leave |

## Step 5: Send Test Email

Use your platform's "Send Test" feature to yourself. Check:
- Subject line personalization
- Creator content blocks
- Image loading
- Link tracking

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Properties missing | Check tracking snippet is firing |
| Images broken | Verify image URLs are absolute |
| Wrong creator showing | Clear profile, re-test |
| Fallback showing when shouldn't | Check property names match |
