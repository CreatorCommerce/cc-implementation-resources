title: 'Co-branded Cart Abandonment'
description: 'Recover abandoned carts with partner-personalized messaging.'
---

Cart abandonment emails are one of the highest-converting flows in e-commerce. Adding partner context makes them even more effective by reinforcing the trusted relationship that brought the customer to your store.

## Why Co-branded Recovery Works

When a customer abandons their cart after clicking a partner's link, they already have a connection to that partner. Leveraging this in your recovery emails:

- **Reinforces trust** — Seeing the partner's name reminds them why they visited
- **Maintains discount visibility** — Partner codes stay front and center
- **Increases open rates** — Personalized subject lines stand out in crowded inboxes

## Key Elements to Include

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Partner Name" icon="user">
    Reference the partner who referred them in subject lines and body copy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discount Reminder" icon="tag">
    Highlight the partner's discount code that's still available.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Images" icon="image">
    Show the exact products left in cart with partner context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Partner Quote" icon="quote-left">
    Include a testimonial or recommendation from the partner.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Subject Lines

- "{{ partner_name }} thinks you forgot something..."
- "Still thinking it over? {{ partner_name }}'s {{ discount }}% off is waiting"
- "Your cart misses you (and so does {{ partner_name }})"

## Implementation

Use CreatorCommerce variables in your Klaviyo or Attentive flows to dynamically insert partner data. See [Variables Reference](/guides/emails/variables-reference) for the full list of available fields.
