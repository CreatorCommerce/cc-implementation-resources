title: 'CPG Product Launch'
description: 'Coordinated partner reveals for new product launches.'
---

New product launches are perfect for co-branded campaigns. Partners get exclusive access, audiences get trusted first looks, and you get a coordinated launch moment across multiple channels.

## The Concept

Select partners get early access to a new product. They create personalized launch content featuring the product alongside their existing favorites. Coordinated posting creates buzz.

## Campaign Structure

```
Launch Campaign Flow
├── Pre-Launch: Seed product to partners
├── Embargo Period: Partners create content
├── Launch Day: Coordinated reveal
│   ├── Partner posts go live
│   ├── Partner pages activated
│   └── Email/SMS push
└── Post-Launch: Sustain momentum
```

## Partner Tiers

| Tier | Access | Expectation |
|------|--------|-------------|
| VIP | 2-3 weeks early, exclusive first | Multiple posts, dedicated content |
| Priority | 1 week early | Launch day post + story |
| General | Launch day | Standard affiliate push |

## Implementation

### Landing Page Template

Create launch-specific pages:
- New product hero with partner endorsement
- Partner's first impressions/review
- Product alongside partner's existing picks
- Launch-exclusive discount

### Content Collection

Before launch, gather:
- Partner's first impressions (written)
- How they'd use/style the product
- Who they'd recommend it for
- Optional: Unboxing/first-use video

### Embargo Management

- Clear embargo dates in partner communication
- CC dashboard shows "launches on [date]"
- Auto-publish pages on launch day
- Track any early breaks

## Launch Day Execution

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 12:00 AM | Partner pages go live |
| 8:00 AM | Email to partner audiences |
| 9:00 AM | Coordinated social posts |
| 12:00 PM | Stories/reels push |
| 6:00 PM | Evening engagement push |

## Content Angles

- "First Look: [Product Name]"
- "I Tried [Brand]'s New [Product]"
