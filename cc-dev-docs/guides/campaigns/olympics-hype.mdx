title: 'Olympics Hype'
description: 'Tap into major cultural sporting moments with co-branded campaigns.'
---

The Olympics (and similar major sporting events) create massive cultural moments. Partners with fitness, sports, or lifestyle audiences can channel that energy into co-branded campaigns that ride the wave.

## The Concept

Align your products with Olympic themes—peak performance, national pride, athletic lifestyle—through partner-curated collections and event-specific content.

## Why It Works

| Cultural Moment | Partner Opportunity |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Opening ceremonies | "Watch party essentials" |
| Specific events | "Train like a [sport] athlete" |
| National pride | "Support Team USA" picks |
| Athletic stories | "Inspired by [athlete]" |
| Closing/wrap-up | "My Olympic favorites" |

## Campaign Structure

```
Olympics Campaign Flow
├── Pre-Games: Build anticipation
│   ├── Partner picks for "Olympic season"
│   └── Watch party and training content
├── During Games: Real-time activation
│   ├── Event-specific pushes
│   └── Reaction content
└── Post-Games: Ride the momentum
    └── "Inspired by the Olympics" theme
```

## Partner Segments

| Partner Type | Campaign Angle |
|--------------|----------------|
| Fitness creators | "Train like an Olympian" |
| Lifestyle influencers | "Watch party hosting" |
| Sports enthusiasts | Event-specific gear |
| Patriotic accounts | Team gear and national pride |
| Wellness creators | Recovery and peak performance |

## Implementation

### Landing Page Themes

Create Olympics-inspired templates:
- Athletic, dynamic visuals
- Gold/silver/bronze accents
- Partner's "medal-worthy picks"
- Event-specific sections if relevant

### Content Collection

Gather from partners:
- Their favorite Olympic events
- Products for watching vs. training
- Personal athletic journey (if relevant)
- Predictions and commentary

### Real-Time Activation

During the games:
- Update partner pages with trending events
- Push content around viral Olympic moments
- Feature partners who compete or have connections

## Timeline

| Phase | Timing | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Buildup | -4 weeks | Announce campaign, collect picks |
| Pre-Games | -1 week | Pages live, anticipation content |
| Opening | Day 1 | Big push, watch party content |
| Competition | Weeks 1-2 | Event-specific, daily highlights |
| Closing | Final days | Wrap-up, reflection content |
| Post-Games | +2 weeks | Ride momentum, clearance |

## Content Angles

- "My Olympic Watch Party Essentials"
- "Train Like a [Sport] Athlete"
- "Gold Medal Picks"
- "What I'm Wearing to Watch the Games"
- "Inspired by [Specific Athlete]"

## Legal Considerations

<Warning>
  The IOC heavily protects Olympic trademarks. Avoid using:
  - "Olympics" or "Olympic" in commercial content
  - Olympic rings or official imagery
  - "Team USA" (use "USA" or "American athletes")
  
  Use general athletic/sporting themes instead of official branding.
</Warning>

## Other Major Sporting Moments

Apply the same framework to:
- World Cup (soccer)
- Super Bowl
- March Madness
- Tennis Grand Slams
- Golf Majors
