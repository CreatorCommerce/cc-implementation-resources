Back to school is a massive retail moment—and partners with parent or student audiences are perfectly positioned to drive it. Co-branded campaigns turn generic "school supplies" messaging into trusted recommendations.

## The Concept

Partners create their personalized back-to-school shopping lists, sharing what they're actually buying for their kids, classrooms, or college dorms. Authenticity drives conversion.

## Audience Segments

| Partner Type | Angle |
|--------------|-------|
| Parent influencers | "What I'm getting for my kids" |
| Teachers | "Classroom essentials I actually use" |
| College students | "Dorm room must-haves" |
| Fitness creators | "Back to routine" gear |
| Productivity influencers | "Set up your semester for success" |

## Campaign Structure

```

├── Hero: "{Partner Name}'s Back to School Picks"
├── Personal context (their kids, classroom, dorm)
├── Curated products by category
│   ├── Supplies
│   ├── Organization
│   ├── Tech
│   └── Comfort/Style
├── Partner's discount

```
