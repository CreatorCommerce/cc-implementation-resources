Co-branded campaigns turn seasonal moments and cultural events into high-converting partner activations. These aren't just discount pushes—they're content-rich experiences that give partners something meaningful to share.

## Why Campaign-Based Co-Branding Works

| Traditional Affiliate | Co-Branded Campaign |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| "Use my code for 20% off" | Partner curates their holiday picks with personal stories |
| Same link year-round | Fresh content for each moment |
| Transactional relationship | Collaborative storytelling |
| Low engagement | High share-ability |
