title: 'Gifting: Unboxing + Try-on'
description: 'Content-first campaigns built around the reveal moment.'
---

Unboxing and try-on content is inherently shareable. Co-branded gifting campaigns turn this content into conversion by linking the moment of delight directly to a personalized shopping experience.

## The Concept

Partners receive curated gift packages to unbox on camera. Their genuine reactions become content that drives traffic to their co-branded page where audiences can shop the same items.

## Why It Works

| Content Type | Conversion Driver |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Unboxing video | Authentic reaction builds trust |
| Try-on/haul | Shows real-world product use |
| "Get ready with me" | Lifestyle integration |
| Gift reveal | Emotional connection |

## Campaign Structure

```
Gifting Campaign Flow
├── Select and ship: Curated boxes to partners
├── Content creation: Partner films unboxing
├── Page activation: Partner's picks go live
├── Publish: Video links to co-branded page
└── Extend: Repurpose content across channels
```

## Gift Box Curation

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Best sellers | Broad appeal, proven conversion |
| New launches | Buzz building, exclusivity |
| Partner's picks | Pre-selected by partner, authentic |
| Surprise box | Genuine reaction content |
| Themed box | Seasonal/campaign alignment |

## Implementation

### Landing Page Setup

Create unboxing-specific pages:
- Featured video embed (their content)
- Products from the unboxing
- "Shop [Partner]'s Box" CTA
- Related products they might also like

### Content Guidelines

Share with partners:
- No script—genuine reactions only
- Show packaging and presentation
- Highlight 2-3 favorite items
- Mention their personalized shop link
- Include discount code verbally

### Video Distribution

| Platform | Format | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| YouTube | Long-form unboxing | Evergreen, SEO value |
| TikTok | Quick cuts, reactions | Trend-friendly, viral potential |
| Instagram Reels | Polished highlights | Aesthetic focus |
| Stories | Behind-the-scenes | Casual, immediate |

## Activation Flow

1. **Ship boxes** with tracking and arrival coordination
2. **Partner creates content** within agreed timeframe
3. **Partner pages go live** before content publishes

## Content Angles
