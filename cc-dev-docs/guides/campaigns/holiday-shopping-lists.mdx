Holiday shopping lists are the quintessential co-branded campaign—partners share their personal picks, audiences trust the curation, and you capture high-intent seasonal traffic.

## The Concept

Each partner creates a personalized "holiday picks" or "gift guide" featuring products they genuinely recommend. Their audience gets trusted curation; you get attributed sales.

## Campaign Structure

```
Partner's Holiday Page
├── Hero: "{Partner Name}'s Holiday Picks"
├── Personal intro: Why they chose these
├── Curated product grid (5-15 items)
├── Category sections (For Him, For Her, Under $50)
├── Partner's discount code
└── Gift guide download (optional lead capture)
```

## Implementation

### Landing Page Template

Create a holiday-themed landing page template:
- Festive visuals and color scheme
- Partner photo and personal message
- Product grid with their drops
- Category filtering (by recipient, price, etc.)

### Partner Content Collection

Use CC forms to gather:
- Their top holiday picks (product selection)
- Personal message about their choices
- Gift-giving philosophy or tips
- Optional: Short video intro

### Activation Timeline

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| -4 weeks | Announce campaign to partners |
| -3 weeks | Partners submit their picks |
| -2 weeks | Review and publish pages |
| -1 week | Partners preview and prep content |

## Content Angles

Partners can frame their lists as:
- "My Gift Guide for \{Year\}"
- "What I'm Giving Everyone This Year"
- "The Only Gifts You Need"
- "\{Partner Name\}'s Holiday Must-Haves"
- "Gifts for People Who Have Everything"

## Holiday Variations

| Holiday | Angle |
|---------|-------|
| Christmas/Hanukkah | Traditional gift guides |
| Valentine's Day | "Gifts They'll Actually Love" |
| Mother's/Father's Day | Curated picks for parents |
| Graduation | Celebration and transition gifts |
| Black Friday | "My Top Picks to Shop" |
