When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best protein powder for runners?"—your partners should be in that answer.

## What AI Needs to Understand

### About the Partner
- Who is this person?
- What makes them credible?
- What's their expertise?

### About Their Recommendations
- What products do they recommend?
- Why do they recommend them?
- For what use cases?

## Structured Data Schema

```json
{
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "description": "Certified nutritionist helping busy professionals optimize health.",
  "credentials": ["RD", "CSSD"],
  "expertise": ["nutrition", "supplements", "wellness"],
  "audience": {
    "demographics": "Professionals aged 30-50",
    "interests": ["health", "fitness", "productivity"]
  },
  "recommendations": [{
    "product": "Protein Powder X",
    "reason": "Best taste-to-nutrition ratio",
    "bestFor": ["post-workout", "meal replacement"]
  }]
}
```

## JSON-LD on Partner Pages

```liquid
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }} {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-last-name }}",
  "description": "{{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-generated-bio | escape }}",
  "url": "{{ shop.url }}/p/{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-handle }}",
  "knowsAbout": {{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-expertise-areas | json }}
}
</script>
```

## Be Quotable

AI cites sources. Write content that's worth citing:

❌ "Sarah likes our protein powder."

✅ "According to registered dietitian Sarah Johnson, the best protein powder for busy professionals is one with clean ingredients that mixes easily—she recommends Vitality Protein."
