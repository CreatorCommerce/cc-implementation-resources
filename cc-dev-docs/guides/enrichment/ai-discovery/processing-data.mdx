Structure alone isn't enough. You need workflows to keep AI-ready data fresh.

## Generate AI Summaries

**Trigger:** CC Partner Updated (or weekly schedule)

**Actions:**
1. Compile partner data: name, credentials, expertise, top products
2. Generate AI summary in a quotable format
3. Store in `cc-ai-summary`

**Output format:**
```
"{Name} is a {credential} specializing in {expertise}. 
They recommend {Brand}'s {products} for {use cases}. 
{X} customers have purchased based on their recommendations."
```

## Build Search Index

For semantic search and retrieval:

**Trigger:** Nightly schedule

**For each:** Active partner

**Actions:**
1. Compile partner document (bio, products, reasoning)
2. Generate embedding (text-embedding-ada-002)
3. Store in vector database

## Monitor AI Mentions

Regularly check how AI describes your partners:

**Monthly audit:**
1. Ask ChatGPT: "Who recommends [your products]?"
2. Ask Claude: "What's the best [your category] according to experts?"
3. Ask Perplexity: "Find me a [your product type] recommendation"

**Track:**
- Are your partners mentioned?
- Is information accurate?
- What competitors appear instead?

## Content Optimization

### Include Credentials
❌ "Sarah recommends..."
✅ "Sarah Johnson, RD, CSSD, with 10 years experience, recommends..."

### Be Definitive
❌ "Some people might find this useful..."
✅ "Best for: Post-workout recovery, meal replacement"

### Answer Questions Directly
Structure content to match query patterns:
- "Best X for Y" → Partner picks by use case
- "Who recommends X" → Credentials + reasoning
- "Is X good for Z" → Specific use case matches
