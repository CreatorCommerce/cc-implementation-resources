Partners share links. Those links need to work forever.

## Vanity URL Creation

When a partner is activated, create their clean URL:

**Trigger:** CC Partner Activated

**Actions:**
1. Generate handle from name ("Sarah Johnson" → "sarah-johnson")
2. Handle conflicts ("sarah-johnson-2")
3. Create redirect: `/p/sarah-johnson` → `/pages/creator?handle=sarah-johnson`
4. Store in `cc-vanity-url` and `cc-full-url`

**Result:** Partners get clean, shareable URLs immediately.

## Handle Changes

When a partner updates their name or requests a new URL:

**Trigger:** CC Creator Field Updated (cc-creator-shop-handle)

**Actions:**
1. Get old handle from previous value
2. Create 301 redirect: `/p/\{old\}` → `/p/\{new\}`
3. Notify partner of new URL

**Why:** Old links in social bios, bookmarks, and Google still work.

## Link Expiration

For time-limited campaigns:

**Trigger:** Campaign end date reached

**Actions:**
1. Update redirect: `/c/\{campaign\}/\{partner\}` → `/p/\{partner\}`
2. Archive campaign data
3. Preserve for reporting

## Common Patterns

| Scenario | Redirect |
|----------|----------|
| New partner | `/p/\{handle\}` → creator page |
| Name change | `/p/\{old\}` → `/p/\{new\}` |
| Campaign end | `/c/\{campaign\}/\{partner\}` → `/p/\{partner\}` |
| Partner exit | `/p/\{handle\}` → `/` (homepage) |
