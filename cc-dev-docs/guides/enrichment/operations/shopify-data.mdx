Keep Shopify objects organized with automatic tagging and metafield updates.

## Order Tagging

When an order is attributed:

**Trigger:** CC Order Attributed

**Actions:**
- Add tag `cc-attributed`
- Add tag `cc-partner:{handle}`
- Add tag `cc-tier:{partner-tier}`
- Add tag `cc-campaign:{campaign-id}` (if applicable)
- Add order note: "Attributed to {partner name} via CreatorCommerce"

**Use:** Filter orders in admin, create reports by partner.

## Customer Tagging

On first partner-referred purchase:

**Trigger:** CC Order Attributed

**Condition:** Customer doesn't have tag "cc-referred"

**Actions:**
- Add tag `cc-referred`
- Add tag `cc-first-referrer:{handle}`

**Use:** Build Klaviyo segments of partner-referred customers.

## Product Tagging

When products are featured by partners:

**Trigger:** CC Drop Updated (products added)

**Actions:**
- Add product tag `cc-featured`
- Update metafield `cc.featured_by_count`

**Use:** Show "Featured by X partners" badges.

## Metafield Updates

Sync CC data to Shopify metafields for theme use:

```liquid
{% comment %} Access CC data via metafields {% endcomment %}
{% assign featured_count = product.metafields.cc.featured_by_count %}

{% if featured_count > 5 %}
  <span class="badge">Featured by {{ featured_count }}+ creators</span>
{% endif %}
```
