description: 'Pull data from orders attributed to partners to enrich their profiles.'

Every order attributed to a partner contains valuable signals. Aggregate them to build rich profiles.

## What Order History Reveals

| Data Point | How to Extract | What It Enables |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Top products | Count line items by product | Auto-curate drops |
| Category affinity | Group by collection | Match to campaigns |
| AOV pattern | Average order totals | Predict partner quality |
| Geographic spread | Shipping addresses | Local event targeting |
| Repeat rate | Customer order frequency | Identify sticky partners |

## Example: Auto-Curate Top Products

When a partner hits 10 orders, set their featured products based on what actually sells:

**Trigger:** CC Order Attributed

**Condition:** Partner order count = 10 (or 25, 50, 100)

**Actions:**
1. Aggregate order data by product
2. Sort by quantity, take top 8
3. Update `cc-auto-top-products` field

**Result:** Partner drops show their proven best-sellers.

## Using in Templates

```liquid
{% assign auto_products = cc_creator.data.value.cc-auto-top-products %}
{% assign manual_products = cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-drops[0].cc-creator-drop-products %}
{% assign products = manual_products | default: auto_products %}

<section class="cc-products">
  <h2>{{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s Top Picks</h2>
  {% for product_handle in products %}
    {% render 'product-card', product: all_products[product_handle] %}
  {% endfor %}
</section>
```
