description: 'How CreatorCommerce uses Shopify Flow as the orchestration layer for all content workflows.'
---

All CC content workflows run through Shopify Flow—Shopify's native automation platform. This keeps everything inside Shopify's ecosystem with no external dependencies.

## Why Shopify Flow?

- **No external services** — No Zapier, Make.com, or third-party orchestration
- **Native data access** — Read/write CC metaobjects, orders, customers directly
- **Visual builder** — Your ops team can modify workflows without code
- **Built-in reliability** — Shopify handles retries, failures, execution guarantees

## How It Works

```
Partner Event (created, updated, order)
         │
         ▼
    Shopify Flow
         │
         ├── Condition checks
         ├── CC Actions (update fields, generate content)
         ├── Shopify Actions (tags, metafields)
         └── External Actions (HTTP, Klaviyo)
         │
         ▼
    CC Custom Fields updated
         │
         ▼
    Templates render enriched data
```

## Getting Started

1. Open Shopify Admin → Apps → Flow
2. Create new workflow
