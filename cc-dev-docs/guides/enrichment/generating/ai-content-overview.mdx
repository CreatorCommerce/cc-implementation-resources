title: 'AI Content Generation'
description: 'Overview of using AI to create bios, headlines, and personalized content.'
---

Fetching data gets you what already exists. Generating data creates what doesn't—bios, headlines, testimonials, product recommendations.

## What You Can Generate

| Content Type | Inputs Needed | Output Example |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Partner bio | Name, niche, brand | "Sarah is a wellness coach helping busy professionals..." |
| Landing headline | Name, discount, season | "Shop Sarah's Spring Favorites" |
| Product testimonial | Product, partner persona | "I've tried dozens—this is the only one I use daily." |
| Why I recommend | Product details, style | "As a mom of three, I don't have time for complicated routines..." |
| Email subject lines | Campaign type, partner | ["Sarah's pick just restocked", "Your exclusive 20%"] |

## Generation Patterns

### On Create
Generate content the moment a partner joins:
- Trigger: CC Partner Created
- Action: Generate bio, headline
- Result: Landing page ready in seconds

### On Data Change
Regenerate when source data changes:
- Trigger: CC Creator Field Updated (niche, content-style)
- Condition: Content was auto-generated (not manually edited)
- Action: Regenerate dependent content

### Product-Triggered
Generate testimonials when products are added:
- Trigger: CC Drop Updated
- For each: Newly added product
- Action: Generate testimonial for that product

## Quality Control

- **Automated validation** — Check length, prohibited phrases, required elements
- **Human review** — Queue premium partners for approval
- **A/B testing** — Generate multiple variants, track performance
