title: 'Using OpenAI & Claude'
description: 'Custom content generation with OpenAI, Claude, and other LLMs.'
---

For custom generation needs or if you have existing LLM infrastructure.

## OpenAI Example

```javascript
const prompt = `
Write a short, authentic bio for an affiliate partner.

Partner: ${creator.firstName} ${creator.lastName}
Niche: ${creator.niche}
Brand: ${shop.name}
Brand voice: ${brandVoice}
Their audience: ${creator.audienceDescription}

Requirements:
- Under 50 words
- Sound human, not salesy
- Mention why they chose this brand
- Match the brand voice
`;

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
});
```

## Claude Example

```javascript
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet",
  max_tokens: 150,
  messages: [{
    role: "user",
    content: `Generate a product testimonial for ${product.name} 
              from the perspective of ${creator.firstName}, 
              a ${creator.niche} with a ${creator.contentStyle} style.
              Keep it under 30 words and first-person.`
  }]
});
```

## Prompt Templates

### Bio Template
```
You are writing a short bio for {partnerName}, a {niche} 
who has partnered with {brandName}.

Write 2-3 sentences that:
1. Establish who they are and their expertise
2. Explain why they partnered with this brand
3. Sound authentic, not marketing-speak
```

### Testimonial Template
```
Write a first-person testimonial from {partnerName} about {productName}.

Requirements:
- First person ("I", "my")
- Mention specific benefit they'd care about
- Under 30 words
- Sound like something they'd actually say
```

## Cost Management

- **Generate once** — Don't regenerate unnecessarily
- **Batch processing** — Cheaper for high volume
- **Tiered investment** — More generation for premium partners
- **Cache results** — Store and reuse
