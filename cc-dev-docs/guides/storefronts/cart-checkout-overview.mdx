The cart and checkout experience is where conversions happen. CreatorCommerce ensures partner branding and discounts persist through the entire purchase journey.

## Cart Personalization

Keep partners visible even after visitors leave the landing page:

- **Partner attribution in cart** — Show which partner referred the customer
- **Automatic discount application** — Partner codes applied without manual entry
- **Cross-sell opportunities** — Suggest additional products from the partner's recommendations

## Checkout Integration

CreatorCommerce works natively with Shopify's checkout:

- **Discount code preservation** — Partner discounts carry through checkout
- **Attribution tracking** — Sales correctly attributed to the referring partner
- **Post-purchase flows** — Trigger partner-specific thank you messages and follow-ups
