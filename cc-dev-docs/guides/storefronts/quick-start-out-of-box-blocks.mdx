<Info>
**Fastest path to launch.** This guide walks you through setting up a complete co-branded storefront using CreatorCommerce's pre-built sections. Perfect for getting started quickly and testing your setup.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and test your storefront, you need:

1. **At least one collaboration synced** — A creator partnership must exist in CreatorCommerce
2. **Test creator set up** — Create a test creator to preview your build
3. **Test destination configured** — Map a test tier to your creator template

### Step 1: Create a Test Creator

**Why:** You need a creator with data to test your storefront. Building is possible without one, but testing requires real creator data.

**How to set up:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a test program/tier in your affiliate software">
    Set up a test tier (e.g., "Test Program" or "Development Tier") in your affiliate platform (Shopify Collabs, Impact, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a test creator">
    Create a test creator with a John Doe-style profile:
    - Name: "Test Creator" or "John Doe"
    - Email: Your email (so you can access onboarding)
    - Assign to your test tier
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync to CreatorCommerce">
    The creator should automatically sync to CreatorCommerce. Verify they appear in your CreatorCommerce dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure test destination">
    In CreatorCommerce, go to **Settings → Destinations** and create a test destination mapped to your test tier. This routes affiliate traffic to your creator template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete test creator onboarding">
    Click on your test creator in CreatorCommerce, then click **Copy onboarding link**. Go through the onboarding flow to:
    - Add a profile photo
    - Write a bio
    - Create product collections (drops)
    - Add product reviews/notes
    - Upload UGC content
    
    **Why this matters:** Your storefront will be much more interesting and realistic if your test creator has actual content, reviews, and product collections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Don't skip onboarding your test creator.** A storefront with real content, reviews, and collections is much easier to design and test than an empty one.
</Warning>

## Theme Setup

### Step 1: Enable CreatorCommerce SDK

**Location:** Theme Editor → App Embeds

**Why:** The SDK detects affiliate context and writes cart attributes (`cc-creator-handle`, `cc-creator-id`) that power all personalization. This is essential for full-funnel tracking and personalization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Theme Editor">
    In Shopify Admin → **Online Store → Themes → Customize**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open App Embeds">
    In the left sidebar, click **App embeds**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable CreatorCommerce SDK">
    Find "CreatorCommerce" in the list and toggle it **on**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** to apply the change
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Do this first.** Enabling the SDK early ensures tracking works from the start and you can test personalization immediately.
</Info>

### Step 2: Create Creator Template

**Location:** Theme Editor → Page Templates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Page Picker">
    In the Theme Editor, click **Homepage** to open the page picker menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Creator">
    Scroll down and click **Creator** (or search for "creator")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Template">
    Click **Create template**. This creates your base CreatorCommerce template (`templates/metaobject/creator.json`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What you have now:** An empty creator page template. Next, we'll populate it with sections.

### Step 3: Copy Homepage Sections

**Why:** Starting with your homepage gives you a one-to-one copy to work from. Your creator page will have the same structure, but personalized for creators.

**Two methods:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Easy Way (Recommended)">
    **Copy the JSON file:**
    
    1. In your theme files, open `templates/index.json`
    2. Copy all contents
    3. Open `templates/metaobject/creator.json`
    4. Paste the contents
    5. Save
    
    **Result:** Your creator template now has all your homepage sections.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Section by Section">
    **If you prefer the visual editor:**
    
    1. In Theme Editor, open your homepage
    2. For each section, click the section → **Duplicate**
    3. Switch to your creator template
    4. Click **Add section** → Find the duplicated section
    5. Repeat for all sections (can take a while with 25+ sections)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**What you have now:** A creator template that's a duplicate of your homepage. Next, we'll replace the hero section with a creator-specific hero.

---

## Hero Section Setup

### Replace Homepage Hero with Creator Hero

**Why:** Your homepage hero changes with seasonal offers and campaigns. Your creator hero should be consistent to the creator's offer, which flexes with their content and discounts (all dynamic anyway).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your hero section">
    In your creator template, locate your homepage hero section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove the homepage hero">
    Click the section → **Remove section**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add CC Hero section">
    Click **Add section** → Search for "CC" → You'll see:
    - **CC Hero - Equinox** — Immersive, animated gradient hero with WebGL effects
    - **CC Hero - Primavera** — Clean, minimal hero with carousel support
    
    For this guide, we'll use **CC Hero - Primavera**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Primavera Hero">
    Click **CC Hero - Primavera** to add it
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What you'll see:** Initially, the hero will look bland—just a background. Your fonts should be applied. This is normal. Now we'll configure it.

### Configure Primavera Hero Section

Click on the hero section to open its settings. Here's what to configure:

#### Content & Copy

**Eyebrow (Creator Badge Text):**
- **Recommended:** `Recommended by [cc-creator-first-name]`
- This appears as a small badge at the top

**Heading:**
- Replace the default lorem ipsum with something engaging
- **Examples:**
  - `Shop with [cc-creator-first-name]`
  - `Discover this new product line with [cc-creator-first-name]`
  - `Go nude with [cc-creator-first-name]` (for a clothing brand called "Nudes")

**Description Text:**
- Make it digestible and value-focused
- **Example:** `Get [cc-collab-discount-amount]% off by shopping my curated collections. Also check out the new spring collection.`

**Trust Indicator:**
- Typically better for health/beauty brands
- For apparel, you can clear this out
- **Example:** `Trusted by 10,000+ customers`

**CTA Button:**
- **Button Text:** `Shop my curations` (or similar)
- **Button Link:** `#drops-anchor` (scrolls to curated collections section)

#### Collab Highlight

**Show Collab Highlight:**
- Options:
  - `Show first name` — Displays creator's first name
  - `Show shop title` — Displays creator's shop title
  - `Hide labels` — Shows logo/photo without text
  - `Hide component` — Hides the entire collab highlight

**Recommended:** `Show first name` for most use cases

#### Carousel Display

**Carousel Type:**
- **Social Design** — Instagram/TikTok-style story carousel
- **Inline Carousel** — Traditional product carousel

**Fallback Video:**
- If no UGC is uploaded by the creator, show a tasteful fallback video
- Keeps the hero engaging even without creator content

#### Styling

**Background:**
- Set a background color
- Optionally set a background image
- Set text color (or use auto-contrast)

**Auto Contrast:**
- **Enabled:** Text color automatically adjusts (white on dark backgrounds, black on light)
- **Disabled:** Use manual text color

**Additional Styling Options:**
- Badge background color
- Badge border color
- Button background color (override theme or use theme default)
- Border widths
- Border radius (for sharp corners)
- Vertical padding (all devices)
- Accent text size
- Uppercase accent text toggle
- Star adjustment (for trust indicators)
- Left padding for desktop (when carousel is on left)

**Custom CSS:**
- Apply custom CSS as needed for advanced styling

## Product Sections

### Choose Your Product Section

CreatorCommerce offers two main product section types:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CC Products - Curated Lists">
    **Best for:** Higher SKU stores (10+ products)
    
    - Great for apparel
    - Great for health & beauty
    - Creators can make multiple collections (drops)
    - Dropdown selector to switch between drops
    - "Add Bundle to Cart" functionality
    
    **When to use:** Stores with many products where creators curate multiple themed collections
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CC Products - Curated Bundle">
    **Best for:** Lower SKU stores (< 10 products)
    
    - Showcases bundles of products
    - Simpler, focused display
    - Great for smaller catalogs
    
    **When to use:** Stores with fewer products where creators recommend complete bundles
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**For this guide:** We'll focus on **CC Products - Curated Lists** (most common use case).

### Add Curated Lists Section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Section">
    In your creator template, click **Add section**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for CC">
    Type "CC" in the search to filter CreatorCommerce sections
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select CC Products - Curated Lists">
    Click **CC Products - Curated Lists** to add it
  </Step>
</Steps>

**What you get:** A pre-built product grid section that:
- Automatically pulls in creator drops
- Shows a dropdown to switch between drops
- Includes a pre-made product card
- Supports "Add Bundle to Cart"

### Customize Product Card

**Option 1: Use Pre-Built Card (Default)**
- The section comes with a pre-made product card
- Works out of the box
- Good for quick launches

**Option 2: Use Your Theme's Product Card**

If you want to use your theme's existing product card (with quick add, aspect ratio settings, etc.):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Your Theme's Product Card">
    In your theme files, search for `product-card` or `card-product` (usually in `snippets/`)
    
    **Tip:** Check your featured collection section or any product list section—they likely use your theme's product card
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Snippet">
    Open the product card snippet file and copy its contents
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste into Curated Lists Section">
    In the Theme Editor:
    1. Click on your **CC Products - Curated Lists** section
    2. Find the **Custom Product Card** or **Product Card Snippet** setting
    3. Paste your snippet code
    
    **Alternative:** If the section has a snippet selector, choose your theme's product card snippet
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Your curated lists now use your theme's product card with all its bells and whistles (quick add, aspect ratios, etc.).

## Product Page Customization

### Add Creator Quote Sections

When customers view products, show creator endorsements and quotes. CreatorCommerce offers two complementary sections:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="CC Product - Quote Badge">
    **What it is:** A sticky banner that appears when a creator has a note or media for the product
    
    **Features:**
    - Shows creator avatar
    - Displays product quote/note
    - Shows UGC attached to product
    - Expandable to reveal full quote and media carousel
    - Sticky positioning options
    
    **Best for:** Prominent, always-visible creator endorsement
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="CC Product - Quote Editorial">
    **What it is:** An editorial-style quote display
    
    **Features:**
    - Shows the same quote as the badge
    - More editorial, magazine-style presentation
    - Shows creator image
    - Different visual treatment
    
    **Best for:** Editorial, story-driven product pages
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Recommendation:** Use **both** sections together. They show the same quote but in different formats—the badge is a sticky banner, the editorial is more integrated into the page flow.

### Add Quote Sections to Product Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Product Template">
    In Theme Editor, go to your product template (usually `templates/product.json` or the default product template)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Section">
    Click **Add section** → Search for "CC"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Quote Badge">
    Add **CC Product - Quote Badge** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Quote Editorial">
    Add **CC Product - Quote Editorial** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    For each section, configure:
    - Visibility settings
    - Position (for badge: fixed top, fixed bottom, or natural)
    - Styling (colors, fonts, spacing)
    - Behavior (expand on click, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Preview as Creator

**How to test:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Preview as Creator">
    In the Theme Editor, find **Preview as creator** or **Select preview as creator** option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch Product">
    You'll also need to switch the product preview to a product that has a review from the selected creator
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Sections">
    The quote badge and editorial sections will appear on the product page when:
    - Creator context is active (via cart attributes or metaobject page)
    - The creator has a product enhancement (note or media) for that product
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Note:** If a creator doesn't have a note or media for a product, these sections won't display (by design).
