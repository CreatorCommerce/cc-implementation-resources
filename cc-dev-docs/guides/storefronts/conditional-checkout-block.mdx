description: 'Create a customized Shopify checkout block that appears only for affiliate-attributed purchases.'

## What This Does

Shopify's checkout extensibility lets you add custom blocks (banners, messages, upsells) to the checkout page. With CreatorCommerce, you can make these blocks **conditional** — they only appear when a shopper came through a creator's affiliate link.

## Use Cases

- Show a "Thanks for shopping with [Creator]!" message at checkout
- Display the creator's discount confirmation
- Add a co-branded banner with the creator's photo
- Surface a loyalty or referral prompt specific to affiliate purchases

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Shopify Checkout Editor">
    In Shopify Admin → **Settings → Checkout → Customize checkout**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a new block">
    In the checkout editor, add a new block where you want the affiliate content to appear (e.g., Order Summary section, Thank You page).

    Choose a block type like **Banner**, **Text**, or **Image with text**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your co-branded content">
    Populate the block with your affiliate-specific messaging. For example:

    - **Heading:** "You're getting an exclusive deal!"
    - **Body:** "Your creator discount has been applied at checkout."
    - **Image:** A co-branded banner or icon
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set display rules">
    This is the key step. Add a **display condition** to the block:

    - **Condition type:** Cart attribute
    - **Attribute:** `cc-creator-id`
    - **Rule:** `is not empty`

    This ensures the block **only renders** when the shopper has a CreatorCommerce creator attribution in their cart — meaning they came through an affiliate link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Display Condition Reference

| Condition | Attribute | Rule | When It Shows |
|-----------|-----------|------|---------------|
| Any affiliate purchase | `cc-creator-id` | is not empty | Shopper came through any creator link |
| Specific campaign | `cc-campaign-id` | equals `[campaign-id]` | Shopper from a specific campaign |

## Best Practices

- Keep checkout blocks simple — don't add friction to the checkout flow
- Reinforce the discount or value proposition, don't introduce new decisions
- Test with both affiliate and non-affiliate checkouts to verify conditional rendering
- Use the Thank You page for richer co-branded content (less impact on conversion)
