Co-branded landing pages are the entry point for your partner-driven traffic. Each landing page dynamically adapts to showcase the partner's content, recommendations, and branding.

## What Makes a Great Landing Page

A co-branded landing page should:

- **Greet visitors with partner context** — Display the partner's name, photo, and personalized message
- **Showcase curated products** — Feature the partner's recommended products or collections
- **Maintain brand consistency** — Use your brand's design language while incorporating partner elements
- **Drive clear actions** — Guide visitors toward purchase with compelling CTAs
