## The Problem

CreatorCommerce auto-generates a Shopify collection for each creator's drop. When you have 50+ creators, this creates dozens of collections that clutter your Shopify Admin collections list.

## The CC // Prefix Convention

CreatorCommerce prefixes auto-generated collection titles with `CC //`:

```
CC // Sarah's Summer Picks
CC // Mike's Fitness Favorites
CC // Elena's Beauty Essentials
```

This prefix serves two purposes:
1. **Identification** — Instantly tells your team which collections are CC-managed
2. **Filtering** — Enables Shopify Admin filtered views

## Setting Up Filtered Views

### Create a "Hide CC" View

1. Go to **Products → Collections** in Shopify Admin
2. Click the filter icon
3. Add filter: **Title** → **does not contain** → `CC //`
4. Save as a view: **"Store Collections"** (your daily working view)

### Create a "CC Only" View

1. Same location, add filter: **Title** → **contains** → `CC //`
2. Save as a view: **"CC Collections"** (for when you need to manage CC-specific collections)

## Customer-Facing Display

When displaying CC collection titles on the storefront, strip the prefix:

```liquid
{{ collection.title | remove: "CC // " }}
```

This ensures shoppers see clean titles like "Sarah's Summer Picks" instead of "CC // Sarah's Summer Picks".

## Excluding CC Collections from Navigation

If your theme lists all collections in navigation or sitemaps, exclude CC collections:

```liquid
{% for collection in collections %}
  {% unless collection.title contains 'CC //' %}
    <a href="{{ collection.url }}">{{ collection.title }}</a>
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Important Notes

- **Don't rename CC collections** — CreatorCommerce manages these titles. Manual changes will be overwritten on the next sync.
- **Don't delete CC collections** — They will be re-created when the creator's data syncs. If you need to remove a collection, deactivate the creator's drop in CreatorCommerce.
- **Collections are required** — Each drop needs a Shopify collection for product display on landing pages. The collections are functional, not decorative.
