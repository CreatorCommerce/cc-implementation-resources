## The Problem

CreatorCommerce may create collections for creator drops. These can clutter your Shopify Admin collections list.

## Solution 1: Use a Naming Convention

Prefix creator collections with a pattern:

```
_cc_sarah-jones-picks
_cc_mike-smith-favorites
```

Collections starting with `_` are often filtered in admin views.

## Solution 2: Use Collection Metafields

Tag CC collections with a metafield:

```json
{
  "namespace": "creatorcommerce",
  "key": "is_creator_collection",
  "value": "true"
}
```

Then filter in your catalog views.

## Solution 3: Hide from Storefront Navigation

In your collection list templates, exclude CC collections:

```liquid
{% for collection in collections %}
  {% unless collection.handle contains '_cc_' %}
    <a href="{{ collection.url }}">{{ collection.title }}</a>
  {% endunless %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Solution 4: Use Smart Collections

Instead of creating separate collections, use smart collections that automatically include products based on tags or metafields.

## Best Practice

- Use a consistent naming pattern
- Document the pattern for your team
- Exclude from navigation programmatically
- Keep creator collections for attribution tracking
