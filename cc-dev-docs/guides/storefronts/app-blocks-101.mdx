## What Are App Blocks?

App blocks are pre-built UI components you can add to your theme via the theme editor—no code required.

## Available CC App Blocks

| Block | Purpose | Where to Use |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **CC Creator Hero** | Full creator intro section | Landing pages |
| **CC Product Grid** | Creator's product picks | Landing pages, collections |
| **CC Quote Badge** | Creator testimonial | Product pages |
| **CC Discount Banner** | Persistent discount reminder | Any page |
| **CC Email Capture** | Newsletter with attribution | Landing pages, footer |

## Adding App Blocks

1. Go to Online Store → Themes → Customize
2. Navigate to the page/section
3. Click "Add block" or "Add section"
4. Find blocks under "CreatorCommerce"
5. Configure settings
6. Save

## Block Settings

Each block has customizable settings:

- **Display options** — Layout, colors, spacing
- **Content overrides** — Custom text fallbacks
- **Visibility** — Show only with creator context
- **Preview** — Test with a specific creator handle

## When to Use App Blocks

✅ **Use app blocks when:**
- Quick implementation needed
- No developer resources
- Testing co-branding concept
- Standard layouts work for your brand

❌ **Use custom sections when:**
- Pixel-perfect brand matching required
- Complex layouts needed
- Deep integration with existing components

## Combining Approaches

Start with app blocks, then migrate to custom sections as you refine your design.
