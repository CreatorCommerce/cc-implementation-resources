## Important Context

CreatorCommerce is primarily delivered as **theme sections/snippets** (Liquid-native), not standard Shopify app blocks.

In Theme Editor, go to **Sections** and search `CC` to find these components.

## CC Sections (`cc-*.liquid`)

These are the primary storefront components in `cc-liquid-templates/`:

| Section File | Theme Label / Preset | What it does | Best used on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cc-hero-primavera-mini-shell.liquid` | `CC Hero - Primavera` | Co-branded hero with creator identity, dynamic text, CTA, and media carousel behavior. | Creator landing pages |
| `cc-hero-equinox.liquid` | `CC Hero - Equinox` | Alternate hero style with badge, heading/accent, CTA, and floating stat card patterns. | Creator landing pages |
| `cc-drops-product-curated-lists-shell.liquid` | `CC Products - Curated Lists` | Multi-drop product listing section with dropdown switching and optional fallback collection behavior. | Landing pages, product-list areas |
| `cc-drops-product-signature-bundles-shell.liquid` | `CC Products - Signature Bundles` | Bundle-oriented drop presentation with “add all” purchase flow and bundle storytelling UI. | Landing pages, campaign bundles |
| `cc-product-quote-badge.liquid` | `CC Product - Quote Badge` | Sticky/inline quote badge for creator endorsement plus discount messaging and media expansion. | Product pages |
| `cc-product-quote-editorial.liquid` | `CC Product - Quote Editorial` | Editorial-style creator quote block with avatar/author treatment for PDP storytelling. | Product pages |
| `cc-banner-momentum.liquid` | `CC Banner - Momentum` | Compact creator banner for persistent reminder of who the shopper is browsing with. | Landing, collection, cart-adjacent contexts |
| `cc-block-instructions.liquid` | `CC App Block Instructions` | Design-mode instructional helper (not a shopper-facing production block). | Theme-editor setup only |

## Underlying CC Snippets (`snippets/cc-*.liquid`)

These power the section logic and are reused across multiple CC sections:

| Snippet File | Purpose | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `snippets/cc-hero-primavera-base-snippet.liquid` | Base renderer for Primavera hero output and dynamic creator-aware content. | `cc-hero-primavera-mini-shell.liquid` |
| `snippets/cc-drops-product-curated-list-base-snippet.liquid` | Core logic/UI for curated lists, product grids, dropdown behavior, and pricing hooks. | `cc-drops-product-curated-lists-shell.liquid` |
| `snippets/cc-drops-product-signature-bundles-base-snippet.liquid` | Core bundle rendering and drop/fallback behavior for signature bundles. | `cc-drops-product-signature-bundles-shell.liquid` |
| `snippets/cc-process-dynamic-text.liquid` | Replaces dynamic text tokens (including nested creator paths and defaults). | Hero, banner, quote, list, and bundle sections |
| `snippets/cc-calculate-contrast-color.liquid` | Computes readable foreground color from background values. | Hero, banner, and quote styling paths |
| `snippets/cc-price.liquid` | Calculates creator-adjusted product pricing outputs. | Curated list product rendering |
| `snippets/cc-custom-product-card.liquid` | Optional override for custom product card markup in curated lists. | Curated lists when custom card is enabled |

## Adding CC Sections in Theme Editor

1. Go to Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Customize.
2. Open the target template (landing page, product page, etc.).
3. Add a **Section** and search `CC`.
4. Pick the relevant section (Hero, Products, Quote, Banner).
5. Configure settings from the schema controls.
6. Save and test with creator context active.

## What To Customize First

- Dynamic text fields (creator-aware copy)
- Fallback behavior (what shows when creator/drop data is missing)
- Colors/contrast controls
- Product-card mode (`default` vs `cc-custom-product-card`)
