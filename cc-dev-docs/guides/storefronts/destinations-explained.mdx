## What is a Destination?

A **Destination** is a core CreatorCommerce feature that controls **where shoppers land** after clicking an affiliate link. It connects your affiliate tiers to specific co-branded shopping experiences, ensuring every click leads to a page designed to convert.

## The Three Core Parts

### 1. Collaboration Tiers
Every CC campaign has tiers (e.g., "Ambassadors", "Influencers", "Affiliates"). Each tier can have its own destination configuration.

### 2. Landing Page Logic
The destination defines which page template the shopper sees. This can be:
- A metaobject-powered creator landing page
- A collection page
- A product page
- A custom page

### 3. Optional Query Parameters
Destinations can append query parameters to the landing URL for additional control over what the shopper sees.

## How Destinations Work

```
Creator shares their affiliate link
       ↓
Link routes through CC redirect (/apps/cc-storefront/redirect)
       ↓
CC resolves: Which creator? → Which tier? → Which destination?
       ↓
Shopper lands on the configured co-branded page
       ↓
Cart attributes set → Personalized experience begins
```

## Destination Types

| Type | URL Pattern | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Creator Landing Page** | `/pages/creators/{{shop.handle}}` | Dedicated creator storefronts |
| **Collection** | `/collections/[collection-handle]` | Product-focused experiences |
| **Product** | `/products/[product-handle]` | Direct product promotion |
| **Homepage** | `/` | Full-funnel site personalization |
| **Custom Page** | `/pages/[page-handle]` | Campaign-specific pages |

## Configuring Destinations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your campaign">
    In the CreatorCommerce dashboard, open the campaign you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a tier">
    Choose the collaboration tier you want to set a destination for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the landing page">
    Choose where traffic for this tier should land. For most use cases, the **Creator Landing Page** (metaobject page template) is the best starting point.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add query parameters (optional)">
    Append parameters to control the experience further. The most common:

    ```
    ?view=[template-name]
    ```

    The `view` parameter tells Shopify which page template to render, letting you use different layouts for different campaigns or tiers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The `?view=` Parameter

The `view` query parameter is a powerful way to switch between different page templates for the same metaobject type. This means you can create multiple landing page designs and route different campaigns to different layouts.

**Example:** You have two landing page templates:
- `metaobject/creator.json` — Standard layout
- `metaobject/creator.summer-campaign.json` — Summer campaign layout

Set the destination URL to include `?view=summer-campaign` and shoppers will see the summer-specific design.

See [Create a Landing Page Template](/guides/storefronts/create-landing-page-template) for details on creating multiple templates.

## Tier-Driven Destination Strategy

| Tier | Destination | Experience Level |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **VIP / Celebrity** | Custom landing page with full brand takeover | Premium co-branding |
| **Ambassador** | Creator landing page with drops, UGC, bio | Full co-branded storefront |
| **Influencer** | Standard landing page with product grid | Standard co-branding |
| **Affiliate** | Collection page or homepage with personalization | Lightweight co-branding |

## Linking Affiliate Platforms

When using an affiliate platform (Social Snowball, Refersion, GRIN, etc.), set the platform's **landing page URL** to the CreatorCommerce redirect:

```
https://your-store.myshopify.com/apps/cc-storefront/redirect
```

CreatorCommerce handles the rest — resolving the affiliate, determining their destination, and routing traffic to the right co-branded experience.
