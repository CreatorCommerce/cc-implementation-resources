## What is a Destination?

A **Destination** is where you send traffic for a co-branded experience. When a creator shares their link, customers land on their personalized destination.

## Destination Types

| Type | URL Pattern | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Creator Page** | `/pages/creators/sarah-jones` | Dedicated landing page |
| **Collection** | `/collections/sarahs-picks` | Product collection |
| **Product** | `/products/serum?ref=sarah` | Direct product link |
| **Custom** | `/shop/sarah` | Custom routing |

## How Destinations Work

```
Creator shares link → Customer clicks → CC resolves creator
       ↓                    ↓                   ↓
  Unique URL          Landing page         Personalized UI
```

## Creating Destinations

Destinations are automatically created when you:

1. Create a collab in CreatorCommerce
2. The creator's metaobject generates a page
3. Their unique handle becomes the URL

## Linking to Destinations

Creators can link to any page and append their handle:

```
yourbrand.com/collections/all?ref=sarah-jones
yourbrand.com/products/best-seller?ref=sarah-jones
```

CC tracks the referral and personalizes the experience.
