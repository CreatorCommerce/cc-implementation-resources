description: 'Key information for your eCommerce team after launching CreatorCommerce co-branded experiences.'
---

After launching CreatorCommerce, your eComm team needs to understand what changed and how to manage the new co-branded layer. Share this page with your team.

## What Changed

Your store now has:
- Creator landing pages at `/pages/creators/[handle]`
- Personalized UI when customers shop via creator links
- Automatic discount application via the SDK
- Order and customer attribution to creators
- Auto-generated Shopify collections for each creator's drops

## Side Effects to Be Aware Of

### Auto-Created Collections

CreatorCommerce creates a Shopify collection for each creator's drop. These collections may clutter your Shopify Admin collections list.

**Solution:** CreatorCommerce prefixes these collections with `CC //`. Use Shopify Admin filtered views to hide or isolate them:
1. Go to **Products → Collections** in Shopify Admin
2. Create a saved filter: **Title does not contain** `CC //` for your daily view
3. Create a separate saved filter: **Title contains** `CC //` to manage CC collections when needed

See [Hide CC Collections](/guides/storefronts/hide-cc-collections) for details.

### Shared Theme Sections

CC sections added to your theme are shared with your main theme. Be aware that:
- Theme updates should be tested on a creator page before publishing
- CC sections may appear in the section picker in the theme editor
- Some sections conditionally render creator content

### Discount Codes

Creator discount codes are managed in CreatorCommerce and synced to Shopify. **Do not manually edit or delete CC-created discount codes** — they will be re-created on the next sync.

## SEO Considerations for Co-branded Pages

Co-branded creator pages are personalized shopping experiences, not original content pages. To avoid SEO issues:

### Add noindex Meta Tags

In `theme.liquid`, add a conditional meta tag to prevent search engines from indexing creator pages:

```liquid
{% if request.path contains '/creators/' %}
  <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
{% endif %}
```

### Update robots.txt

In `templates/robots.txt.liquid`, block crawler access to creator pages:

```liquid
{% for group in robots.default_groups %}
  {{- group.user_agent -}}

  {%- if group.user_agent.value == '*' -%}
    {{ 'Disallow: /pages/creator' }}
    {{ 'Disallow: /pages/creator/*' }}
  {%- endif -%}

  {%- if group.sitemap != blank -%}
    {{ group.sitemap }}
  {%- endif -%}
{% endfor %}
```

<Warning>
Without these SEO controls, search engines may index hundreds of similar creator pages, potentially causing duplicate content issues or diluting your site's SEO authority.
</Warning>

## Order Attribution

Orders from creator traffic are tagged automatically:
- `cc-creator-id-xxxxxx` — The creator's ID
- `cc-campaign-id-xxxxxx` — The campaign ID
- `CreatorCommerce` — General tag for all CC-attributed orders

Filter orders in Shopify Admin using these tags. See [Order & Customer Tags](/references/order-customer-tags) for the full reference.

## Managing Pop-ups on Creator Pages

If your store uses marketing pop-ups (email capture, promotions), consider **disabling them on creator landing pages**. The landing page itself serves as the entry experience — a pop-up on top of a co-branded page can hurt conversion rates.

Check your pop-up tool's settings for URL-based targeting rules and exclude `/pages/creators/*`.

## Managing Creators

| Task | Where |
|------|-------|
| Add new creator | CreatorCommerce dashboard |
| Edit creator info | CC dashboard or Shopify metaobjects |
| Disable a creator | Set status to inactive in CC |
| View performance | CC dashboard → Analytics |
| Manage drops | CC dashboard or Creator's own dashboard |

## Common Questions

**"A creator's page isn't showing their photo"**
→ Check their profile in CC — ensure the profile picture is uploaded and the metaobject has synced.

**"Discount isn't applying at checkout"**
→ Verify the discount code exists in Shopify Discounts. Check for conflicts with other active discounts. Ensure the SDK is enabled.

**"Orders aren't being attributed"**
→ Verify cart attributes are being set on landing pages (check browser console). Ensure the SDK theme app embed is enabled.

**"CC collections are cluttering our admin"**
→ See [Hide CC Collections](/guides/storefronts/hide-cc-collections) for filtered view setup.
