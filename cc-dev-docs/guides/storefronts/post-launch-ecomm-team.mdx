## What Changed

Your store now has:
- Creator landing pages at `/pages/creators/[handle]`
- Personalized UI when customers shop via creator links
- Automatic discount application
- Order attribution to creators

## Managing Creators

| Task | Where |
|------|-------|
| Add new creator | CreatorCommerce app |
| Edit creator info | CC app or metaobjects |
| Disable a creator | Set status to inactive in CC |
| View performance | CC dashboard |

## Order Attribution

Orders from creator traffic are tagged:
- `cc-attributed`
- `cc-creator:[handle]`
- `cc-discount:[code]`

Filter orders in Shopify Admin using these tags.

## Discount Codes

Creator discount codes are managed in CC and synced to Shopify. Don't manually edit or delete CC-created discount codes.

## Theme Considerations

- CC sections may appear on landing pages
- Some sections conditionally show creator content
- Test theme updates on a creator page before publishing

## Reporting

- Use CC dashboard for creator-level metrics
- Use Shopify Analytics for overall store performance
- Export attributed orders for commission calculations

## Common Questions

**"A creator's page isn't showing their photo"**
→ Check their profile in CC, ensure image is uploaded

**"Discount isn't applying at checkout"**
→ Verify code exists in Shopify discounts, check for conflicts

**"Orders aren't being attributed"**
→ Check cart attributes are being set on landing pages
