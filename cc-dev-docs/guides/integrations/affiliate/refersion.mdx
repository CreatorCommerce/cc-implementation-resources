Sync Refersion affiliate updates into CreatorCommerce to power creator-aware storefront funnels and attribution context.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** Webhook-based
- **Trigger source:** Refersion webhook events sent to CreatorCommerce
- **Shopify Flow required:** No (direct webhook pattern)

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Affiliate updates | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Offer/tier context | Collab tiers map to partner program structure |
| Conversion trigger events | Discount linkage and attribution context stay current |

## Setup

1. Enable Refersion in CreatorCommerce.
2. Configure Refersion webhooks for affiliate updates and conversion trigger updates to CreatorCommerce endpoints.
3. Keep your offers organized (for many teams, `CC //` offer naming helps isolate co-branded programs).
4. Test by updating one affiliate in Refersion and confirming creator/collab updates in CC.

## Webhook Endpoints (CC API)

Configure Refersion to POST to:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/refersion/webhooks/affiliate/updated?myshopifyDomain=your-store.myshopify.com
POST /webhooks/integrations/refersion/webhooks/conversion-trigger/created?myshopifyDomain=your-store.myshopify.com
Content-Type: application/json
```
