Refersion is a popular affiliate and influencer marketing platform. Integrating it with CreatorCommerce gives your Refersion affiliates personalized co-branded storefronts while maintaining Refersion's tracking and commission management.

## What This Integration Does

| Refersion → CC | CC → Refersion |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Affiliate profiles synced as creators | Co-branded page performance |
| Commission & offer data | Enhanced conversion tracking |
| Affiliate status changes | Attribution signals |
| Offer tier assignments | Storefront visit data |

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create webhooks in Refersion">
    In Refersion, set up four webhooks to push data to CreatorCommerce. Navigate to **Refersion → Settings → Webhooks** and create:

    | Webhook Event | Purpose |
    |---------------|---------|
    | `conversion.created` | Notifies CC when a sale is attributed to an affiliate |
    | `conversion.updated` | Notifies CC when a conversion status changes |
    | `affiliate.created` | Syncs new affiliates to CC as creators |
    | `affiliate.updated` | Updates creator data when affiliate profiles change |

    CreatorCommerce will provide the webhook endpoint URLs during integration setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and update email flows">
    Since CreatorCommerce introduces new affiliate touchpoints (storefronts, onboarding forms, drop notifications), update your email flows accordingly:

    - **Klaviyo** — See [Klaviyo Integration](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo) for CC-aware flows
    - **Mailchimp** — See [Mailchimp Integration](/guides/integrations/email-sms/mailchimp) for Shopify Flow templates
    - **Other providers** — Use CC webhook events to trigger communications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable default Refersion system emails">
    To prevent duplicate communications, disable Refersion's default system emails for programs synced with CreatorCommerce. Your updated email flows will handle all affiliate communication with co-branded context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prefix Refersion Offer titles with CC //">
    Edit the Refersion **Offer** titles that should sync with CreatorCommerce to include the `CC //` prefix:

    ```
    CC // Ambassador Offer
    CC // Influencer Offer
    CC // VIP Partner Offer
    ```

    Only Offers with the `CC //` prefix will sync to CreatorCommerce. This lets you maintain separate Refersion Offers that don't flow into CC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the integration">
    - Verify affiliate data syncs from Refersion to CC
    - Click a test affiliate link and confirm co-branded landing page loads
    - Complete a test purchase and verify attribution in both Refersion and CC
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

```
Refersion affiliate shares link → Refersion tracks click
       ↓
CC redirect captures context → Sets cart attributes
       ↓
Shopper lands on co-branded page → Personalized experience
       ↓
Purchase → Webhook fires → Attributed in both Refersion and CC
```

## Webhook Event Details

### conversion.created
Fired when a sale is attributed to a Refersion affiliate. CreatorCommerce logs this event for funnel analytics and performance reporting.

### conversion.updated
Fired when a conversion status changes (e.g., pending → approved, or refunded). CC updates its analytics accordingly.

### affiliate.created
Fired when a new affiliate is created in Refersion. CC creates a corresponding creator profile with metaobject and collection.

### affiliate.updated
Fired when affiliate profile data changes. CC updates the creator metaobject to keep storefront data current.

## Use Cases

### Upgrade Affiliate Links to Co-branded Pages
Your Refersion affiliates keep their existing commission structure and tracking. CreatorCommerce adds personalized landing pages, product recommendations, and UGC — same economics, dramatically better conversion.

### Offer-Based Campaign Mapping
Map different Refersion Offers to different CC campaigns. Each offer can power a distinct co-branded experience with its own landing page template and product selection.

### Performance Sync
Refersion commission data flowing into CC enables performance-based tier upgrades, bonus campaigns, and automated recognition.
