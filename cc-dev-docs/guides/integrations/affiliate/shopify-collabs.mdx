Shopify Collabs is Shopify's native platform for recruiting, managing, and paying affiliates. Integrating it with CreatorCommerce upgrades your Collabs affiliates from basic referral links to fully personalized co-branded shopping experiences.

## What This Integration Does

| Shopify Collabs → CC | CC → Shopify Collabs |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Approved affiliate profiles | Co-branded page performance |
| Tier assignments | Enhanced conversion tracking |
| Affiliate status changes | Storefront visit data |

The integration runs through **Shopify Flow**, using flow templates that listen for Collabs events and sync data to CreatorCommerce.

## Prerequisites

- **Shopify Flow** installed on your store (free Shopify app)
- **Shopify Collabs** active with at least one affiliate program
- **CreatorCommerce** installed and configured

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Shopify Flow">
    If you haven't already, install [Shopify Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) from the Shopify App Store. It's free and required for this integration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload CreatorCommerce flow templates">
    CreatorCommerce provides pre-built Shopify Flow templates for the Collabs integration. Upload these to your Shopify Flow:

    **Required flows:**
    - `CC__Creator Approved Sync.flow` — Syncs newly approved Collabs affiliates to CC as creators
    - `CC_Tier Assigned Sync.flow` — Updates CC when an affiliate's tier changes in Collabs
    - `CC_Affiliate Appreciation.flow` — Triggers appreciation actions when milestones are hit

    To upload: Go to **Shopify Admin → Apps → Shopify Flow → Import** and select each `.flow` template file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the flows">
    After importing, each flow will be in **Draft** status. Review the flow logic, then toggle each one to **Active**.

    <Warning>
    Review each flow's trigger conditions before enabling to ensure they match your Collabs program structure.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with a new affiliate approval">
    Approve a test affiliate in Shopify Collabs and verify:
    - The Shopify Flow triggers and runs successfully
    - A corresponding creator profile appears in CreatorCommerce
    - The creator's metaobject is created in Shopify
    - The co-branded landing page is accessible
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Flow Details

### Creator Approved Sync

**Trigger:** Shopify Collabs affiliate is approved  
**Action:** Creates a new creator in CreatorCommerce with profile data from Collabs

This flow captures:
- Affiliate name and email
- Program/tier assignment
- Discount code configuration
- Profile data available in Collabs

### Tier Assigned Sync

**Trigger:** Affiliate tier is changed in Shopify Collabs  
**Action:** Updates the creator's tier in CreatorCommerce

When you move an affiliate between tiers in Collabs, CreatorCommerce automatically adjusts their co-branded experience — different landing page templates, product access, or discount levels based on tier configuration.

### Affiliate Appreciation

**Trigger:** Affiliate reaches a sales milestone  
**Action:** Triggers appreciation actions in CC (tier upgrades, special campaigns, etc.)

## Connecting Collabs with Email Providers

Shopify Collabs doesn't natively integrate with email platforms. Use these Shopify Flow templates to bridge the gap:

### Collabs → Klaviyo

Upload these additional flows to sync Collabs data to Klaviyo:
- `CC__Export approved applicants to Klaviyo.flow`
- `CC_Export tier assignments to Klaviyo.flow`

You'll need your **Klaviyo Public API Key** to configure these flows. The flows will track events in Klaviyo that you can use to trigger affiliate email sequences.

See [Klaviyo Integration](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo) for the full Klaviyo setup.

### Collabs → Mailchimp

Upload these flows to sync Collabs data to Mailchimp:
- `CC__Add Creator to MailChimp.flow`
- `CC_Update Creator in MailChimp.flow`

You'll need your **Mailchimp Audience ID** and **API Key** (base64 encoded) to configure the HTTP request actions in these flows. The flows will add approved affiliates to your Mailchimp audience with a `CreatorCommerce Creator` tag.

See [Mailchimp Integration](/guides/integrations/email-sms/mailchimp) for the full Mailchimp setup.

## Use Cases

### Seamless Collabs-to-Storefront Pipeline
Affiliates apply and get approved in Shopify Collabs. Within minutes, they have a personalized co-branded storefront in CreatorCommerce — no manual creator setup needed.

### Tier-Driven Co-branding
Use Collabs tiers to control the level of co-branding:
- **Ambassador tier** → Full custom storefront with drops, UGC, and brand integration
- **Creator tier** → Standard landing page with product grid
- **Affiliate tier** → Basic discount landing page

### Automated Onboarding
Combine the Collabs approval flow with CreatorCommerce onboarding forms to collect additional creator data (bio, photos, product preferences) as soon as they're approved.
