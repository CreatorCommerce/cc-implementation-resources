---

Use Shopify Flow to send Shopify Collabs creator data into CreatorCommerce and power co-branded storefront funnels.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** API sync via Shopify Flow action/webhook call
- **Trigger source:** Shopify Flow event runs and posts payload to CreatorCommerce endpoint
- **Shopify Flow required:** Yes

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Collabs creator profile updates | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Tier assignments and discount context | Collab tier and attribution context stay current |

## Setup

1. Install and configure Shopify Flow.
2. Import CreatorCommerce Collabs flow templates (or equivalent custom flow actions).
3. Enable the flows that push Collabs payloads into CreatorCommerce.
4. Approve/update a test creator in Collabs and confirm sync in CC.

## Trigger Endpoint (CC API)

Your Shopify Flow action should call this endpoint:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/shopify-collabs/webhooks/tier/assigned
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopify_domain": "your-store.myshopify.com",
  "properties": {
    "firstName": "Jill",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "jill@example.com",
    "affiliateCode": "JILL20",
    "shopifyCollabsCommunityMemberId": "12345"
  }
}
```

`shopify_domain` and `properties` are required for the sync handler.
