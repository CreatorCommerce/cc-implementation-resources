Sync Roster program and ambassador data into CreatorCommerce to power co-branded storefront funnels.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** API sync (triggered by a CreatorCommerce sync endpoint)
- **Trigger source:** Your workflow calls the CC sync webhook endpoint, then CC pulls programs/ambassadors from the Roster API
- **Shopify Flow required:** Recommended for scheduled/automated sync runs

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Program and ambassador data | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Discount and referral context | Collab mapping and attribution context stay current |

## Setup

1. Connect Roster credentials in CreatorCommerce (`apiKey`, optional `apiDomain`).
2. Set up Shopify Flow (or another scheduler) to call the CreatorCommerce Roster sync endpoint.
3. Validate a sync run and confirm creator/collab updates in CC.

## Trigger Endpoint (CC API)

Call this endpoint when you want CreatorCommerce to run a Roster sync:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/roster/webhooks/affiliates/sync
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopify_domain": "your-store.myshopify.com"
}
```
