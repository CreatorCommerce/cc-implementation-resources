Sync Superfiliate creator updates into CreatorCommerce to keep creators, collabs, and campaign-linked discount context current.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** Hybrid (webhook event + API enrichment)
- **Trigger source:** Superfiliate webhooks call CreatorCommerce endpoints; CC then calls Superfiliate API for campaign context
- **Shopify Flow required:** No (direct webhook pattern)

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Creator update events | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Campaign metadata and reward context | Collab tiers and attribution fields stay current |

## Setup

1. Connect Superfiliate credentials in CreatorCommerce (`clientId` + `clientSecret`).
2. Configure Superfiliate webhooks to CreatorCommerce for creator update events.
3. Validate by updating a creator in Superfiliate and confirming creator/collab changes in CC.

## Webhook Endpoints (CC API)

Configure Superfiliate to POST to:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/superfiliate/webhooks/creator/updated?myshopify_domain=your-store.myshopify.com
POST /webhooks/integrations/superfiliate/webhooks/campaigns/sync?myshopify_domain=your-store.myshopify.com
Content-Type: application/json
```
