Social Snowball is one of the most popular affiliate platforms on Shopify. Integrating it with CreatorCommerce upgrades your affiliates from basic discount links to fully personalized co-branded storefronts — same attribution, dramatically better conversion.

## What This Integration Does

| Social Snowball → CC | CC → Social Snowball |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Affiliate profiles synced as creators | Co-branded page performance |
| Program tiers mapped to CC campaigns | Enhanced conversion tracking |
| Commission & discount data | Attribution signals |
| Affiliate approval events | Storefront visit data |

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the integration in CreatorCommerce">
    In your CreatorCommerce dashboard, navigate to **Integrations → Social Snowball** and enable the sync. This will begin syncing affiliate data from Social Snowball into CreatorCommerce as creator profiles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update email flows">
    Social Snowball sends default system emails to affiliates. Since CreatorCommerce introduces new touchpoints (storefront links, onboarding, drop notifications), you'll want to update your email flows to include co-branded context.

    Depending on your email provider:
    - **Klaviyo** — See the [Klaviyo integration guide](/guides/integrations/email-sms/klaviyo) for setting up automated flows
    - **SendLane** — Configure affiliate segments with CC event triggers
    - **Mailchimp** — See the [Mailchimp integration guide](/guides/integrations/email-sms/mailchimp) for Shopify Flow setup
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable default Social Snowball emails">
    To avoid duplicate communications, disable the default Social Snowball system emails for programs synced with CreatorCommerce. Your updated email flows will handle all affiliate communication with co-branded context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prefix program titles with CC //">
    For programs that sync with CreatorCommerce, edit the program title in Social Snowball to include the `CC //` prefix:

    ```
    CC // Ambassador Program
    CC // Influencer Program
    ```

    This prefix tells CreatorCommerce which Social Snowball programs to sync. Programs without the prefix are ignored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enrolling a Social Snowball Program into a CC Campaign

Once the integration is enabled, you need to connect specific Social Snowball programs to CreatorCommerce campaigns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new program in Social Snowball (or edit existing)">
    In Social Snowball, create a new program or edit an existing one. Make sure the title includes the `CC //` prefix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the landing page URL">
    Set the program's **landing page** destination to your CreatorCommerce redirect URL:

    ```
    https://your-store.myshopify.com/apps/cc-storefront/redirect
    ```

    This ensures that when affiliates share their links, traffic routes through CreatorCommerce for co-branded personalization and tracking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the program in CreatorCommerce">
    In CreatorCommerce, navigate to the campaign you want to connect. Under **Affiliate Platform**, select the Social Snowball program with the `CC //` prefix. The program's affiliates will begin syncing as creators in that campaign.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the flow">
    Click a test affiliate link and verify:
    - Traffic redirects through CreatorCommerce
    - The co-branded landing page renders with creator data
    - Cart attributes are set correctly
    - The order is attributed in both Social Snowball and CreatorCommerce
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Affiliate Links Work

When Social Snowball is connected, CreatorCommerce handles the redirect layer:

```
Affiliate shares link → Social Snowball tracks click
       ↓
CC redirect captures context → Sets cart attributes
       ↓
Shopper lands on co-branded page → Personalized experience
       ↓
Purchase → Attributed in both SS and CC
```

CreatorCommerce appends its own tracking parameter (e.g., `cc={{tracking-handle}}`) to the affiliate URL without modifying any of Social Snowball's original parameters. This preserves attribution for both platforms.

<Note>
Social Snowball's **Safe Links** provide an additional layer of fraud protection compared to standard discount codes. When using Safe Links with CreatorCommerce, the attribution and redirect flow work identically.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### Upgrade Existing Affiliates to Co-branded Storefronts
Your Social Snowball affiliates already have discount codes and tracking links. Adding CreatorCommerce gives each one a personalized landing page, product recommendations, and UGC — without changing your commission structure.

### Tiered Co-branding by Program
Use different Social Snowball programs mapped to different CC campaigns to offer varying levels of storefront customization:
- **Ambassadors** — Full co-branded landing pages with drops and custom content
- **Micro-influencers** — Simplified product recommendation pages
- **Affiliates** — Basic discount landing pages

### Performance-Based Upgrades
Start affiliates on a basic tier, then upgrade high performers to richer co-branded experiences as they prove ROI.
