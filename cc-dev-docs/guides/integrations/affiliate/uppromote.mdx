Sync UpPromote affiliate data into CreatorCommerce so UpPromote-managed affiliates can power co-branded storefront funnels.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** API sync (triggered by a CreatorCommerce sync endpoint)
- **Trigger source:** Your workflow calls the CC sync webhook endpoint, then CC pulls affiliate data from UpPromote API
- **Shopify Flow required:** Recommended for scheduled/automated sync runs

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Affiliate profile/program data | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Discount code context | Collab discount linkage and attribution context stay current |

## Setup

1. Connect UpPromote credentials in CreatorCommerce.
2. Set up Shopify Flow (or another scheduler) to call the CreatorCommerce UpPromote sync endpoint.
3. Validate a sync run and confirm creator/collab updates in CC.

## Trigger Endpoint (CC API)

Call this endpoint when you want CreatorCommerce to run an UpPromote sync:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/uppromote/webhooks/affiliates/sync
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopify_domain": "your-store.myshopify.com"
}
```
