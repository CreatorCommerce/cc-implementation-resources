GRIN is a comprehensive influencer marketing platform. Integrating it with CreatorCommerce lets you give GRIN-managed influencers personalized co-branded storefronts — turning every campaign into a high-converting shopping experience.

## What This Integration Does

| GRIN → CC | CC → GRIN |
|-----------|-----------|
| Influencer profiles | Co-branded page performance |
| Affiliate code & link groups | Enhanced conversion data |
| Campaign assignments | Storefront visit metrics |
| Tier/group data | Attribution signals |

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit a form to CreatorCommerce">
    Contact CreatorCommerce to initiate the GRIN integration. The team will provision the connection between your GRIN account and CreatorCommerce.

    Email **help@creatorcommerce.shop** with your GRIN account details to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Affiliate Code & Affiliate Link Groups in GRIN">
    In GRIN, update or create **Affiliate Code Groups** and **Affiliate Link Groups** that you want to sync with CreatorCommerce. Prefix these groups with `CC //`:

    ```
    CC // Ambassador Codes
    CC // Influencer Links
    CC // VIP Campaign Links
    ```

    Only groups with the `CC //` prefix will sync to CreatorCommerce. This lets you maintain separate GRIN groups that don't flow into CC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set destination URLs for CC // groups">
    For each `CC //` Affiliate Link Group, set the destination URL to your CreatorCommerce redirect:

    ```
    https://your-store.myshopify.com/apps/cc-storefront/redirect
    ```

    This routes affiliate traffic through CreatorCommerce for co-branded personalization before landing on the storefront.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the integration">
    - Click a test affiliate link from a GRIN influencer
    - Verify the co-branded landing page loads with the correct creator data
    - Confirm cart attributes are set
    - Complete a test purchase and verify attribution in both GRIN and CC
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

```
GRIN influencer shares link → GRIN tracks click
       ↓
CC redirect captures context → Sets cart attributes
       ↓
Shopper lands on co-branded page → Personalized experience
       ↓
Purchase → Attributed in both GRIN and CC
```

The `CC //` prefix acts as the sync signal. CreatorCommerce watches for GRIN groups with this prefix and creates corresponding creator profiles and campaign mappings.

## Use Cases

### Campaign-Specific Storefronts
Map different GRIN campaigns to different CC campaigns. Each campaign can have its own landing page template, product selection, and messaging — all powered by GRIN influencer data.

### Tiered Influencer Experiences
Use GRIN's group structure to offer different co-branding levels:
- **Top-tier influencers** — Full custom storefronts with drops, UGC, and brand takeovers
- **Mid-tier** — Standard landing pages with product recommendations
- **Micro-influencers** — Simplified product grid pages

### Content-to-Commerce Pipeline
GRIN manages content creation workflows. CreatorCommerce turns that content into shoppable storefront experiences — surface creator photos, videos, and endorsements directly on product pages.
