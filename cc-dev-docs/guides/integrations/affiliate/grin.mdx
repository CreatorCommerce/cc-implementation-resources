Sync GRIN influencer/affiliate data into CreatorCommerce so GRIN-managed creators can power co-branded Shopify funnels.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** API sync (triggered by a CreatorCommerce sync endpoint)
- **Trigger source:** Your workflow calls the CC sync webhook endpoint, then CC pulls data from GRIN API
- **Shopify Flow required:** Recommended for scheduled/automated sync runs

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Contacts, activations, discount/link groups | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Affiliate links and code context | Collab tiers and attribution context stay current |
| `CC //` scoped groups/activations | Sync scope can stay isolated to co-branded programs |

## Setup

1. Connect GRIN credentials in CreatorCommerce.
2. Configure GRIN code/link groups you want treated as co-branded groups (many teams use `CC //` naming).
3. Set up a Shopify Flow (or equivalent scheduler) to call the CreatorCommerce GRIN sync endpoint.
4. Validate by running a sync and confirming creator/collab updates in CC.

## Trigger Endpoint (CC API)

Call this endpoint when you want CreatorCommerce to run a GRIN sync:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/grin/webhooks/affiliates/sync
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopify_domain": "your-store.myshopify.com"
}
```
