Sync GoAffPro affiliate data into CreatorCommerce so GoAffPro-managed affiliates can power co-branded storefront funnels.

## Integration Type

- **Mode:** API sync (triggered by a CreatorCommerce sync endpoint)
- **Trigger source:** Your workflow calls the CC sync webhook endpoint, then CC pulls affiliates/groups from GoAffPro API
- **Shopify Flow required:** Recommended for scheduled/automated sync runs

## What This Integration Does

| Source Integration Data | CreatorCommerce Outcome |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Affiliate and group data | Creators/collabs update for co-branded funnels |
| Discount code context | Collab tier mapping and attribution context stay current |

## Setup

1. Connect GoAffPro credentials in CreatorCommerce.
2. Set up Shopify Flow (or another scheduler) to call the CreatorCommerce GoAffPro sync endpoint.
3. Confirm creators/collabs are created or updated after a sync run.

## Trigger Endpoint (CC API)

Call this endpoint when you want CreatorCommerce to run a GoAffPro sync:

```http
POST /webhooks/integrations/goaffpro/webhooks/affiliates/sync
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "shopify_domain": "your-store.myshopify.com"
}
```
