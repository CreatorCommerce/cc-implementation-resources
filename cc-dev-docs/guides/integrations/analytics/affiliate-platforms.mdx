CreatorCommerce preserves tracking context from connected affiliate platforms and appends CC attribution context without breaking partner-platform tracking.

## What This Integration Means

| Behavior | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Existing affiliate tracking parameters are preserved | You can continue reviewing traffic/conversion performance in your affiliate platform |
| CC attribution context is appended alongside platform params | You gain co-branded funnel context while maintaining partner-platform reporting continuity |
| CC funnels route traffic through tracked storefront experiences | Creator/affiliate traffic stays measurable through landing → cart → checkout |

## UTM + Tracking Continuity

When affiliate traffic enters CC funnels, source parameters and connected platform tracking context carry through so you can still evaluate performance inside those tools.
