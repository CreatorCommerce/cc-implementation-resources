CreatorCommerce writes attribution context into Shopify-native surfaces (cart attributes, tags, and related records), so you can analyze performance directly in Shopify workflows and reporting.

## What You Can Analyze in Shopify

| Data Surface | What You Can Review |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Order tags | Which creator/collab influenced conversion |
| Customer tags | Referred-customer cohorts and lifecycle behavior |
| Cart attributes | Creator context carried through checkout |
| Shopify Flow conditions | Triggered automations based on attribution labels |
