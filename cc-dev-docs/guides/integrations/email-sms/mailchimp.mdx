Mailchimp can be connected to CreatorCommerce through Shopify Flow for affiliate email communication and segmentation.

## What This Integration Does

| CC → Mailchimp | Use Case |
|-----------------|----------|
| Creator profiles | Segment creators for email campaigns |
| Tier assignments | Trigger tier-based messaging |
| `CreatorCommerce Creator` tag | Filter and target affiliates |

## Prerequisites

- **Shopify Flow** installed on your store
- **Mailchimp** account with an active audience
- **CreatorCommerce** installed and configured

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Shopify Flow">
    If not already installed, add [Shopify Flow](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) from the Shopify App Store.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload CreatorCommerce Mailchimp flows">
    Upload these pre-built flow templates to Shopify Flow:

    - `CC__Add Creator to MailChimp.flow` — Adds newly approved creators to your Mailchimp audience
    - `CC_Update Creator in MailChimp.flow` — Updates creator profiles in Mailchimp when data changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your Mailchimp credentials">
    You'll need two pieces of information from Mailchimp:

    **Audience ID:**
    In Mailchimp → Audience → Settings → Audience name and defaults → find your **Audience ID**.

    **API Key (base64 encoded):**
    In Mailchimp → Account → Extras → API Keys → create or copy your API key. Then base64 encode it:

    ```
    Base64("anystring:your-api-key-here")
    ```

    The format is `anystring:` followed by your API key, then base64 encoded. This is used in the HTTP request headers within the Shopify Flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the flows">
    Open each imported flow in Shopify Flow and update the HTTP request actions with your Mailchimp credentials:

    - Replace the **Audience ID** in the request URL
    - Replace the **Authorization header** with your base64-encoded API key
    - Verify the Mailchimp data center in the URL matches your account (e.g., `us1`, `us2`, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the flows">
    Toggle each flow from **Draft** to **Active**. Test by approving a creator in CreatorCommerce and verifying they appear in your Mailchimp audience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

The Shopify Flow templates make HTTP requests to Mailchimp's API to add or update audience members. Each creator added to Mailchimp receives a `CreatorCommerce Creator` tag, which you can use for segmentation.

```
Creator approved/updated in CC → Shopify Flow triggers
       ↓
HTTP request to Mailchimp API → Add/update audience member
       ↓
Creator tagged "CreatorCommerce Creator" → Available for segmentation
```

## Use Cases

### Affiliate Welcome Sequences
Use the `CreatorCommerce Creator` tag to trigger welcome email sequences for new affiliates.

### Tier-Based Communication
When a creator's tier changes, the update flow syncs the new tier to Mailchimp. Use merge fields to segment communications by tier level.

### Campaign Announcements
Segment your Mailchimp audience by the `CreatorCommerce Creator` tag to send campaign-specific announcements, new product launches, or seasonal promotions exclusively to affiliates.
