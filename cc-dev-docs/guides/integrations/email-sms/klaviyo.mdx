description: 'Configure Klaviyo for both consumer co-branded lifecycle emails (B2C) and creator lifecycle messaging (B2B).'
---

Klaviyo supports two distinct CreatorCommerce messaging surfaces:

- **B2C consumer co-branding**: customer lifecycle emails personalized to the referring creator.
- **B2B creator lifecycle messaging**: emails/SMS sent to creators/affiliates.

<Warning>
Do not combine these in one flow tree. Keep separate Klaviyo metrics, segments, and templates for B2C vs B2B.
</Warning>

## Consumer Co-branding (B2C): Current Recommended Architecture

Consumer flows are powered by **Shopify Flow templates** that send custom events to Klaviyo via `Track an Event`:

| Shopify Flow Template | Klaviyo Event Name |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| `CC // Log a customer abandoned cart Klaviyo event` | `Creator Checkout Abandoned` |
| `CC // Log a custom post-purchase Klaviyo event` | `Creator Attributed Order` |
| `CC // Log a customer marketing opt-in Klaviyo event` | `Marketing Opt In From Creator` |

Each flow template:
1. Starts from a Shopify trigger (`checkout abandoned`, `order created`, or marketing opt-in event).
2. Validates creator context.
3. Loads creator/collab data with `Get metaobject entry`.
4. Calls Klaviyo `Track an Event`.

### Track an Event Mapping

Common field mapping in the Klaviyo action:

- `Klaviyo Public API Key`: your Klaviyo public key
- `Event Properties`: `{{getMetaobjectEntry.data}}`
- `Customer Properties`: creator/collab fields used in template personalization

Customer properties commonly include:
- `cc-creator-first-name`
- `cc-creator-last-name`
- `cc-creator-profile-picture`
- `cc-creator-shop-title`
- `cc-creator-shop-theme-primary-color`
- `cc-creator-shop-handle`
- `cc-collab-affiliate-link`
- `cc-collab-discount-amount`
- `cc-collab-discount-code`
- `cc-collab-affiliate-code`
- `cc-collab-discount-type`
- `cc-creator-shop-description`

### What To Build in Klaviyo (B2C)

- Cart abandonment flow triggered by `Creator Checkout Abandoned`
- Post-purchase flow triggered by `Creator Attributed Order`
- Welcome/opt-in branch triggered by `Marketing Opt In From Creator`

Use conditional blocks to show creator content only when `cc-*` creator properties exist.

## Creator Lifecycle Messaging (B2B)

For creator/affiliate lifecycle messaging (invites, activation, milestones, campaign messaging), use the creator-facing event model and templates:
