Klaviyo is the primary email integration for CreatorCommerce. It powers two distinct communication channels: **messaging your affiliates** and **personalizing emails to customers** with creator context.

## Two Sides of Klaviyo

### 1. Affiliate Messaging (B2B)
Email/SMS to your creators and affiliates:
- Welcome sequences
- Onboarding reminders
- Performance updates and milestones
- Campaign announcements
- Drop notifications

### 2. Consumer Co-branding (B2C)
Email/SMS to customers with creator personalization:
- Cart abandonment with creator's discount
- Post-purchase with creator thank-you message
- Welcome series with creator intro
- Win-back flows with creator context
