Shopify Flow is the fastest way to prototype and validate integration logic before investing in custom development.

## Why Prototype in Flow?

- **No code required** — Visual builder, instant deployment
- **Real data** — Test with actual CC events and data
- **Quick iteration** — Modify and re-test in minutes
- **Production-ready** — Many prototypes become permanent solutions

## Common Prototypes

### Prototype: CRM Sync

Before building a full CRM integration, test with Flow:

```
Trigger: CC Partner Created
Action: Send HTTP Request to CRM API
Payload: Partner name, email, source
```

**What you learn:**
- Does your CRM accept the data format?
- What fields do you actually need?
- How fast does the sync need to be?

### Prototype: Custom Notifications

Before building a notification service:

```
Trigger: CC Order Attributed
Condition: Order value > $500
Action: Send HTTP Request to Slack webhook
Payload: Partner name, order value, customer
```

**What you learn:**
- What events matter for notifications?
- What data do recipients need?
- What's the right frequency?

### Prototype: External Analytics

Before building analytics integration:

```
Trigger: CC Order Attributed
Action: Send HTTP Request to analytics endpoint
Payload: Partner ID, order ID, value, products
```

**What you learn:**
- What data points matter for analysis?
- How should attribution be structured?
- What aggregations do you need?

## Flow Prototyping Pattern

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the trigger">
    What CC event starts the process?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add conditions">
    When should it actually run?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use HTTP Request action">
    Send data to a test endpoint (Webhook.site, RequestBin).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect payloads">
    See exactly what data is available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">
    Adjust conditions and payloads until it's right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide">
    Keep in Flow, or build custom integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Tools

Use these to capture and inspect webhook payloads:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) | Quick payload inspection |
| [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com) | Persistent webhook capture |
| [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com) | Webhook + processing |

## When to Graduate from Flow

Move to custom integration when:
- You need complex data transformation
- You require guaranteed delivery
- Volume exceeds Flow limits
- You need sub-second latency
