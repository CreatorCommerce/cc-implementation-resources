description: 'Need unique data or custom event handling? We build custom webhook endpoints.'

Standard webhooks not enough? We create custom webhook endpoints for unique integration needs.

## When to Request Custom Webhooks

### Unique Data Requirements
- You need data in a specific format your system expects
- You require aggregated or computed fields
- Your system needs data transformed before receipt

### Custom Events
- You need to trigger on events we don't currently expose
- You want combined events (multiple triggers → one webhook)
- You need conditional webhooks (only fire when X and Y)

### Special Delivery
- Your system requires specific authentication headers
- You need retry logic customized for your infrastructure
- You require guaranteed delivery with acknowledgment

## What We Can Build

| Custom Capability | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| Custom payloads | Include computed fields like lifetime value |
| Filtered events | Only send when order > $100 |
| Batched delivery | Send hourly summary instead of per-event |
| Custom auth | HMAC signatures, OAuth tokens, API keys |
| Retry policies | Custom backoff, max attempts, dead letter |
| Data transformation | Map CC fields to your schema |
