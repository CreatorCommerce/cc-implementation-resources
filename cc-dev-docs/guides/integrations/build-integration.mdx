## Common Integration Examples

### Sync Partner Data to External CRM

Push creator data to your CRM or partner management platform:

```javascript
// Example: Sync new creator to external CRM
const creator = await cc.getCreator(creatorId);

await fetch('https://your-crm.com/api/contacts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${CRM_TOKEN}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: creator.email,
    firstName: creator.firstName,
    lastName: creator.lastName,
    customFields: {
      cc_handle: creator.handle,
      cc_discount_code: creator.discountCode,
      cc_shop_url: creator.shopUrl
    }
  })
});
```

### Enrich Analytics with Partner Context

Send partner attribution to your analytics platform:

```javascript
// Example: Send to analytics when order attributed
shopifyFlow.on('cc_order_attributed', (event) => {
  analytics.track('Purchase', {
    orderId: event.orderId,
    orderValue: event.orderTotal,
    partnerId: event.creatorId,
    partnerHandle: event.creatorHandle,
    discountCode: event.discountCode
  });
});
```

### Automate Partner Onboarding

Trigger external workflows when partners join:

```javascript
// Example: Trigger onboarding sequence
shopifyFlow.on('cc_creator_activated', (event) => {
  // Send welcome email via external ESP
  await emailService.sendTemplate('partner-welcome', {
    to: event.creatorEmail,
    data: {
      firstName: event.creatorFirstName,
      shopUrl: event.creatorShopUrl,
      discountCode: event.discountCode
    }
  });
  
  // Add to Slack channel
  await slack.inviteToChannel('partners', event.creatorEmail);
});
```

## Testing Integrations

  testMode: true  // Use sandbox environment
});
```

### Webhook Testing

Use webhook.site or similar tools to inspect webhook payloads during development.
