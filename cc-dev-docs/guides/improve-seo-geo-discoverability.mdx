## Why Partner Pages Need SEO

Your partner pages aren't just for traffic from partner links—they can also rank in search and AI results for:

- **Partner name searches** — "[Partner Name] + [Your Brand]"
- **Product + recommendation** — "best [product category] recommended by experts"
- **Local searches** — "nutritionist near me + supplements"
- **AI answers** — Featured in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and other AI assistants

Good SEO turns your partner pages into evergreen traffic sources.

## SEO Fundamentals for Partner Pages

### Page Titles

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    **Format:** `[Partner Name]'s [Product/Brand] Recommendations | [Brand]`
    
    **Examples:**
    - "Sarah's Skincare Picks | GlowBrand"
    - "Dr. Jones's Supplement Protocol | HealthCo"
    - "FitnessMom's Workout Essentials | ActiveGear"
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - Keep under 60 characters
    - Partner name first (what they're searching)
    - Brand name for recognition
    - Avoid generic titles
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Implementation">
    In your Liquid template:
    
    ```liquid
    {% capture page_title %}
      {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s 
      {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-tagline | default: 'Picks' }} 
      | {{ shop.name }}
    {% endcapture %}
    
    <title>{{ page_title | strip }}</title>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Meta Descriptions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Best Practices">
    **Format:** Action-oriented description with partner context and value prop.
    
    **Examples:**
    - "Shop Sarah's curated skincare routine. Get 15% off her favorite products with exclusive access to her top picks."
    - "Dr. Jones recommends these supplements for gut health. Professional-grade products with practitioner discount."
    
    **Guidelines:**
    - 150-160 characters
    - Include partner name
    - Mention discount or exclusive access
    - Include call-to-action
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Implementation">
    ```liquid
    {% capture meta_description %}
      Shop {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name }}'s curated 
      {{ shop.name }} picks. 
      {% if cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount %}
        Get {{ cc_creator.cc-collab-discount-amount }}% off 
      {% endif %}
      with exclusive access to their top recommendations.
    {% endcapture %}
    
    <meta name="description" content="{{ meta_description | strip }}">
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### URL Structure

**Good URLs:**
```
/pages/creators/sarah-jones
/shop/recommended-by/dr-sarah-jones
/partners/fitness-mom-picks
```

**Bad URLs:**
```
/pages/creator?id=12345
/p/c/sj123
/partner-page-1
```

**Guidelines:**
- Human-readable
- Include partner name/handle
- Consistent pattern across all partner pages
- Avoid query parameters in canonical URL

## Structured Data (Schema Markup)

### Why Structured Data Matters

Structured data helps search engines understand your pages and enables rich results like:

- Star ratings
- Product information
- Author/creator attribution
- FAQ snippets
- Breadcrumbs

### Person Schema for Partners

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Sarah Jones",
  "jobTitle": "Wellness Influencer",
  "url": "https://yourstore.com/pages/creators/sarah-jones",
  "image": "https://cdn.yourstore.com/sarah-jones.jpg",
  "sameAs": [
    "https://instagram.com/sarahjones",
    "https://tiktok.com/@sarahjones"
  ]
}
```

### Product Collection Schema

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Sarah Jones's Top Picks",
  "description": "Curated product recommendations from Sarah Jones",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "item": {
        "@type": "Product",
        "name": "Product Name",
        "url": "https://yourstore.com/products/...",
        "image": "...",
        "offers": {
          "@type": "Offer",
          "price": "49.99",
          "priceCurrency": "USD"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementing Schema in Liquid

```liquid
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-first-name | append: ' ' | append: cc_creator.cc-creator-last-name | json }},
  "url": {{ request.origin | append: request.path | json }},
  "image": {{ cc_creator.data.value.cc-creator-profile-picture | json }},
  "description": {{ cc_creator.cc-creator-shop-description | json }}
}
</script>
```

## GEO/Local SEO

For practitioners and location-based partners, local SEO drives relevant traffic.

### LocalBusiness Schema

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",

  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Wellness Way",
    "addressLocality": "Portland",
    "addressRegion": "OR",
    "postalCode": "97201"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": "45.5234",
    "longitude": "-122.6762"
  },
  "telephone": "(503) 555-1234",
  "url": "https://yourstore.com/pages/practitioners/dr-sarah-jones"
}
```

### Location-Based Content

For practitioner pages, include:

<Checklist>
  - [ ] Practice name and location
  - [ ] Service area/regions covered
  - [ ] "Near me" friendly content
  - [ ] Local landmarks or neighborhood references
