- Apply custom CSS classes and IDs for brand consistency
- Create professional, accessible forms

## Security & Sanitization

### How We Keep Your Forms Safe

All HTML content you add to your forms is automatically sanitized before rendering. Our system:

- **Prevents XSS attacks** by removing dangerous scripts and event handlers
- **Strips harmful attributes** like `onclick`, `onerror`, and `onload`
- **Blocks unsafe tags** such as `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and `<object>`
- **Allows only formatting tags** that enhance visual presentation
- **Preserves safe attributes** including `class`, `id`, `href`, and `style`

You can confidently use HTML knowing that your forms and respondents are protected.

### Text Formatting

**`<b>` and `<strong>`** - Bold text  
Use for important terms or emphasis.
```html
<strong>Required:</strong> Please provide your full name
```

**`<i>` and `<em>`** - Italic text  
Use for citations, definitions, or subtle emphasis.
```html
Answer in <em>your own words</em>
```

**`<u>`** - Underlined text

```

### Structure & Organization

**`<p>`** - Paragraphs  
Separate content into readable blocks.
```html
<p>This is the first paragraph with important context.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph with additional details.</p>
```

**`<br>`** - Line breaks  
Add single line breaks within text.
```html

```

**`<hr>`** - Horizontal rule  
Create visual separators.
```html

```

**`<div>` and `<span>`** - Generic containers  
Group content for styling with classes or IDs.
```html

<span class="required-field">*</span>
```

### Headings

**`<h1>` through `<h6>`** - Section headings  
Organize content hierarchically.
```html
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<h4>Contact Details</h4>
```

**Best Practice:** Use h3-h6 in form labels to maintain proper document hierarchy.

### Lists

**`<ul>`** - Unordered (bulleted) lists
```html
<ul>
  <li>First option</li>
  <li>Second option</li>
  <li>Third option</li>
</ul>
```

**`<ol>`** - Ordered (numbered) lists
```html
<ol>
  <li>Step one: Review the guidelines</li>

  <li>Step three: Submit your response</li>
</ol>
```

### Links

**`<a href="...">`** - Hyperlinks  
Link to external resources or documentation.

```

**Attributes allowed:** `href`, `target`, `title`, `class`, `id`

```html
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" class="external-link">
  Click here for more information
</a>
```

### Code & Preformatted Text

**`<code>`** - Inline code
```html
Enter the value <code>API_KEY</code> from your dashboard
```

**`<pre>`** - Preformatted text  
Preserves spacing and line breaks.
```html
<pre>
function example() {
  return true;
}
</pre>
```

### Tables

**`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`** - Data tables  
Display structured information.
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Option A</td>
    <td>First choice</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Option B</td>
    <td>Second choice</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Using Classes and IDs

### CSS Classes

Apply custom styling by adding `class` attributes to your HTML elements. Classes allow you to maintain consistent branding and visual hierarchy across your forms.

**Syntax:**
```html
<p class="your-class-name">Content here</p>
<div class="highlight primary-color">Important notice</div>
```

**Multiple classes:**
```html
<span class="required-field bold red-text">*</span>
```

**Common use cases:**
- Brand colors and typography
- Spacing and layout control
- Visual emphasis and highlighting
- Responsive design adjustments

### IDs

Use `id` attributes to uniquely identify specific elements, useful for linking or JavaScript interactions.

**Syntax:**
```html
<div id="unique-identifier">Content</div>
<h3 id="section-personal-info">Personal Information</h3>
```

**Best practices:**
- IDs must be unique within the form
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Avoid starting IDs with numbers

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Required Field with Emphasis

**Input:**
```html
<strong class="required-label">Email Address</strong>
<span class="required-asterisk">*</span>
<br>
<small>We'll never share your email with anyone else.</small>
```

**Result:**  
Creates a bold required label with an asterisk and explanatory text below.

---

### Example 2: Instruction List

**Input:**
```html
<h4>Before you begin:</h4>
<ul class="instruction-list">
  <li>Have your employee ID ready</li>
  <li>Allocate 10-15 minutes to complete</li>
  <li>Ensure you have supporting documents</li>
</ul>
```

**Result:**  
Creates a clear set of instructions with a heading and bulleted list.

### Example 3: External Resource Link

**Input:**
```html
<p>Please review our 
<a href="https://example.com/guidelines" target="_blank" class="external-link">
  submission guidelines
</a> before completing this section.</p>
```

**Result:**

  <p><em>Rate your satisfaction from 1 (Very Dissatisfied) to 5 (Very Satisfied)</em></p>
  <hr>
  <small>Your response is confidential and will only be used for internal analysis.</small>
</div>
```

**Result:**  
Well-structured description with context, instructions, and privacy notice.

### Example 5: Highlighted Notice

**Input:**

## Best Practices

### Accessibility

1. **Use semantic HTML** - Use headings, lists, and paragraphs appropriately
2. **Provide link context** - Make link text descriptive (avoid "click here")
3. **Add title attributes** - Provide additional context for links and abbreviations
4. **Maintain color contrast** - Ensure text is readable against backgrounds
5. **Structure content logically** - Use proper heading hierarchy

### Styling Guidelines

1. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-format your questions
2. **Be consistent** - Use the same classes throughout your form
3. **Test responsiveness** - Ensure formatting works on mobile devices
4. **Use meaningful class names** - Make them descriptive and maintainable
5. **Prioritize readability** - Formatting should enhance, not distract

### Content Organization

1. **Break up long text** - Use paragraphs and lists
2. **Highlight key information** - Use bold or mark for important details
3. **Provide context** - Use descriptions to explain what you're asking
4. **Include examples** - Show respondents what format you expect
5. **Add helpful links** - Reference external resources when needed

## Prohibited Elements

For security reasons, the following are automatically removed:

- `<script>` tags and JavaScript code
- `<iframe>` and embedded content
- `<form>` and form input elements
- `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<applet>` tags
- Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, `onerror`, etc.)
- `<style>` tags (inline styles via `style` attribute are allowed)
- `<base>` tags that could redirect links
- `<meta>` tags and other document-level elements

---

## Troubleshooting

### My HTML isn't appearing

**Possible causes:**
- You're using a prohibited tag that was removed during sanitization
- There's a syntax error in your HTML (unclosed tags, missing quotes)
- The content exceeds character limits

**Solution:** Validate your HTML and ensure you're only using allowed tags.

### My classes aren't styling the content

**Possible causes:**
- The CSS classes aren't defined in your form's stylesheet
- Class names have typos or don't match exactly
- Styles are being overridden by more specific selectors

**Solution:** Verify class names and check with your form administrator about available styles.

### Links aren't working

**Possible causes:**
- Missing `http://` or `https://` protocol in href
- Invalid URL format
- Relative URLs that don't resolve correctly

**Solution:** Always use complete URLs with protocol (https://example.com).
