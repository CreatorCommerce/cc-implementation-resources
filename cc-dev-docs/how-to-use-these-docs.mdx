# How to Use These Docs Effectively

These documentation files are designed with **LLM-forward** principles in mind, meaning they're optimized for use with Language Learning Models (LLMs) like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor's AI assistant. This page explains how to get the most out of these docs.

## The LLM-Forward Approach

### What Does "LLM-Forward" Mean?

**LLM-forward documentation** is structured to provide complete, contextual information that AI assistants can easily understand and act upon. Instead of requiring you to piece together information from multiple sources, these docs contain comprehensive context within each file.

This approach follows the same documentation strategy used by leading AI platforms like Claude, which provides detailed context upfront so the AI can generate better, more accurate responses.

### Why This Matters

**Traditional documentation:**
- Requires you to read multiple pages
- Makes you connect dots between concepts
- Forces you to remember context across sessions
- Leads to incomplete implementations

**LLM-forward documentation:**
- Provides complete context in one place
- Allows AI to connect concepts automatically
- Enables accurate, context-aware assistance
- Results in better implementations

## How to Use These Docs with LLMs

### Method 1: Copy Entire Docs

**Best for:** Getting comprehensive, context-rich assistance on a specific topic.

**When to use:**
- Starting a new implementation
- Learning a new concept
- Need deep understanding of a topic
- Building complex features

**How to do it:**
1. Open the relevant documentation file
2. Copy the entire contents (Cmd/Ctrl + A, then Cmd/Ctrl + C)
3. Paste into your LLM prompt, prefaced with:
   ```
   I'm working with CreatorCommerce. Here's the documentation for [topic]:
   
   [paste full doc content]
   
   Now help me [your specific question/task]
   ```

**Example:**
```
I'm working with CreatorCommerce. Here's the documentation for drops and products:

[paste entire drops-products-data-model.mdx]

I need to build a section that shows a creator's drops. Can you help me write the Liquid code?
```

### Method 2: Copy Multiple Related Docs

**Best for:** Building features that require understanding multiple concepts.

**When to use:**
- Building co-branded experiences (needs data model + storefronts docs)
- Implementing drops (needs drops docs + custom fields)
- Setting up integrations (needs API docs + data models)

**How to do it:**
1. Identify all relevant documentation files
2. Copy each file's contents
3. Combine them in one prompt with clear section headers

**Example:**
```
I'm building a co-branded product page. Here's the relevant CreatorCommerce documentation:

=== Data Model Overview ===
[paste data-model-overview.mdx]

=== Drops & Products Data Model ===
[paste drops-products-data-model.mdx]

=== Custom Fields Reference ===
[paste custom-fields-reference.mdx]

Now help me build a product page that:
1. Shows the creator's review/note for the current product
2. Displays the product with custom fields from the drop
3. Shows other products from the same drop
```

### Method 3: Selective Context Extraction

**Best for:** Quick questions about specific topics.

**When to use:**
- Quick reference questions
- Clarifying specific concepts
- Understanding particular patterns
- Troubleshooting specific issues

**How to do it:**
1. Find the specific section you need
2. Copy that section plus relevant context around it
3. Include any related code examples or patterns

**Example:**
```
I'm working with CreatorCommerce and need to match products in drops. Here's the relevant section from the drops documentation:

[paste "Product Matching" section + code examples]

I'm getting a type mismatch error. Can you help me fix it?
```

### Method 4: Progressive Context Building

**Best for:** Complex implementations that build on each other.

**When to use:**
- Building multiple related features
- Iterative development
- Learning while building
- Refactoring existing code

**How to do it:**
1. Start with high-level overview docs
2. Add specific docs as you drill into features
3. Include your current code for context
4. Ask for incremental improvements

**Example (Session 1):**
```
I'm starting to build with CreatorCommerce. Here's the data model overview:

[paste data-model-overview.mdx]

Help me understand how creator data flows through the system.
```

**Example (Session 2):**
```
Continuing from where we left off. I've got the basic structure. Now I need to access drops. Here's the drops documentation:

[paste drops-products-data-model.mdx]

And here's my current code:
[paste your code]

Help me iterate the drops properly.
```

### Method 5: Complete Context Dumps

**Best for:** Comprehensive implementations from scratch.

**When to use:**
- Building entire features from scratch
- Complex implementations requiring full context
- Want AI to consider all possibilities
- Need optimal, best-practice implementations

**How to do it:**
1. Identify all relevant documentation
2. Copy everything (data models, API references, patterns, examples)
3. Provide clear, specific requirements
4. Ask for complete implementation

**Example:**
```
I'm building a creator directory grid. Here's all the CreatorCommerce documentation I think is relevant:

=== Glossary ===
[paste glossary.mdx]

=== Creator & Collab Data Model ===
[paste creator-collab-data-model.mdx]

=== Data Model Overview ===
[paste data-model-overview.mdx]

=== Custom Fields Reference ===
[paste custom-fields-reference.mdx]

Build me a complete Shopify section file for a creator directory grid that:
- Shows all public creators
- Displays profile picture, name, and bio
- Links to creator pages
- Filters by tags (optional)
- Is responsive and accessible
```

## Best Practices for LLM Prompts

### 1. Always Include Relevant Context

**Don't do this:**
```
How do I access creator drops?
```

**Do this:**
```
I'm working with CreatorCommerce. Here's the drops documentation:

[paste drops-products-data-model.mdx]

How do I access creator drops in Liquid? I'm on a regular product page, not a metaobject page.
```

### 2. Be Specific About Your Context

**Don't do this:**
```
Help me build a product page.
```

**Do this:**
```
I'm building a product page that shows creator reviews. Here's the relevant documentation:

[paste drops-products-data-model.mdx section on product enhancements]

I need to:
1. Find if the current product is in any of the creator's drops
2. Display the enhancement note if found
3. Show the creator's name and profile picture

Current product context: {{ product }}
Creator context: Available via cart attributes
```

### 3. Include Your Current Code

**Don't do this:**
```
Fix this code:
[code with no context]
```

**Do this:**
```
I'm working on accessing creator drops. Here's the CreatorCommerce drops documentation:

[paste relevant sections]

And here's my current implementation:
[paste your code]

I'm getting [specific error]. Can you help me fix it following the patterns in the documentation?
```

### 4. Reference Specific Patterns

**Don't do this:**
```
How do I match products?
```

**Do this:**
```
Looking at the "Product Matching" pattern in the drops documentation:

[paste that section]

I'm trying to match products but having trouble with the ID comparison. Can you show me the correct way based on this pattern?
```

### 5. Ask for Improvements Based on Best Practices

**Don't do this:**
```
Is this code good?
```

**Do this:**
```
Here's my code for accessing creator data:

[paste your code]

And here's the CreatorCommerce documentation on data access patterns:

[paste relevant sections]

Can you review my code and suggest improvements based on the best practices in the documentation?
```

- `data-model-overview.mdx`
- Relevant data model docs (creator-collab, drops-products, etc.)
- `custom-fields-reference.mdx`
- `shopify-integration-data-model.mdx`

**Why:** Need data structures, access patterns, and Shopify integration details.

### Learning the Platform

**Start with:**
1. `the-3-ms.mdx` - Understand the philosophy
2. `getting-started.mdx` - Platform overview
3. `glossary.mdx` - Learn terminology
4. `data-model-overview.mdx` - Understand architecture
5. Then dive into specific topics as needed

## Copying Docs: Tips & Tricks

### Tooling Recommendations

**For Desktop:**
- Use your code editor to open `.mdx` files
- Full file selection is easier in editors
- Some editors have "copy file path" features

**For Web:**
- Use the Mintlify docs site if available
- Browser extensions for selecting all content
- Use "View Source" if available

**For AI Tools:**
- Cursor: Open file in editor, select all, paste into chat
- ChatGPT/Claude: Copy from editor, paste in chat
- Some tools support file uploads (use `.mdx` or convert to `.md`)

### Organizing Your Prompts

**Use clear section headers:**
```
=== CreatorCommerce Documentation ===

=== Glossary ===
[paste]

=== Data Model Overview ===
[paste]

=== My Question ===
[your specific question]
```

**Use code blocks for code:**
```
Here's the pattern from the docs:
```liquid
{% assign cc_creator = ... %}
```

And my current code:
```liquid
[your code]
```
```

### Handling Long Docs

**If docs are too long for your LLM:**
1. Break into logical sections
2. Start with overview, add details as needed
3. Use progressive context building
4. Focus on most relevant sections first

**Most LLMs handle these docs fine:**
- Individual docs are sized for typical context windows
- Combine 2-3 docs usually works well
- Modern LLMs handle 50k+ tokens easily

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Building a Product Review Section

**Prompt:**
```
I need to build a product page section that shows creator reviews. Here's the CreatorCommerce documentation:

=== Drops & Products Data Model ===
[paste drops-products-data-model.mdx]

=== Creator & Collab Data Model ===
[paste creator-collab-data-model.mdx - sections on access patterns]

=== Shopify Integration Data Model ===
[paste shopify-integration-data-model.mdx - sections on metaobject access]

Build me a Shopify section file that:
1. Finds if the current product is in any creator's drops
2. Displays the enhancement note if found
3. Shows creator name and profile picture
4. Handles missing data gracefully

Section file name: `sections/cc-product-review.liquid`
```

**Why this works:**
- AI has complete context on how drops work
- Understands product matching patterns
- Knows access patterns for creator data
- Can generate code following documented patterns

### Example 2: Understanding the Data Model

**Prompt:**
```
I'm new to CreatorCommerce. Help me understand the data model:

=== Data Model Overview ===
[paste data-model-overview.mdx]

=== Creator & Collab Data Model ===
[paste creator-collab-data-model.mdx]

Explain:
1. How creators relate to channels/brands
2. How drops relate to creators and collections
3. How I access this data in Liquid templates
4. Common patterns I should know
```

**Why this works:**
- AI can explain relationships clearly
- Can connect concepts across docs
- Provides examples from the documentation
- Helps you understand the "why" behind patterns

### Example 3: Troubleshooting Code

**Prompt:**
```
I'm having trouble matching products in drops. Here's the relevant documentation:

=== Drops & Products Data Model - Product Matching ===
[paste "Product Matching" section with ID comparison patterns]

And my current code:
```liquid
{% for json_drop in cc_creator.data.value['cc-creator-drops'] %}
  {% for drop_product in json_drop['cc-creator-drop-products'] %}
    {% if product.id == drop_product['cc-creator-drop-product-shopify-id'] %}
      <!-- Match found -->
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

The condition never matches. Can you help me fix it based on the documentation patterns?
```

**Why this works:**
- AI sees the documented pattern
- Can compare to your code
- Understands the ID type conversion issue
- Can explain why the fix works
