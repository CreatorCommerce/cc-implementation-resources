Buttah Skin, with the tagline “Skincare for melanin rich skin tones”, has built its identity around representation, high efficacy, and community.   They offer products designed specifically to address challenges often neglected in mainstream skincare for deeper skin: dark spots, uneven tone, glow/radiance, texture — all without white cast, with plant and clinical science.

With such a strong product position (6k+ 5 star reviews), and aspirations to get their influencer program fired up, they knew they wanted to invest in making the most of every session they could get with an early program.

‍

Despite strong creator relationships and a passionate community, traditional affiliate links we not well equipted to maintain the story creators were telling, and they created momentum-loss as traffic transitioned from content from someone they trusted into a funnel with a new brand they were just getting to know. An opportunity existed to bridge this brand introduction by merging the 2 together on an introductory landing page.

‍

The team needed a way to transform partner traffic into sales while keeping the experience authentically tied to their mission of building a community around skincare for melanin-rich skin. The program was being setup on Social Snowball, and from there they looked at adding on the CreatorCommerce integration.

‍

The strategy: co-branded landing pages
Working with CreatorCommerce, Buttah Skin launched co-branded landing pages for their top creator partners. These weren’t just repackaged product pages > they were curated storefronts, each blending Buttah’s premium brand with the unique voice of the creator sending the traffic.

Personalized context: Each page featured creator photography, testimonials, and curated product bundles.
Seamless flow: Visitors arrived from an influencer’s link and immediately saw a page that felt like a collaboration, not a handoff.
Community mirror: By spotlighting trusted voices within the melanin-rich community, the pages reinforced the brand’s positioning and helped customers see themselves reflected in the story.

The results
The impact was clear in the numbers:

Conversion Rate (CVR): +30%
By tailoring landing experiences to the creators’ audiences, Buttah Skin significantly lifted the percentage of visitors who converted. The co-branded pages created trust, clarity, and urgency—resulting in stronger CVR across campaigns.
Average Order Value (AOV): +78%
Beyond more conversions, customers were buying more. Bundles curated by creators not only educated customers on complete routines but also increased basket size. Instead of a single cleanser, shoppers often purchased multi-step regimens recommended by trusted creators.
‍

Building more than transactions
The strategy wasn’t just about metrics. By giving creators a co-branded presence, Buttah Skin built a mirror around its community and a space where melanin-rich skin wasn’t an afterthought but the hero. These pages became digital hubs of trust, representation, and shared story.

“CreatorCommerce allowed us to take better care of the traffic we’ve been fighting so hard for. It’s not easy building a new program, but they worked with us like a team member to dial in something that made sense for our unique community.”
— Tomara Watkins, President, Buttah Skin

Buttah’s use-case shows the power of co-branded commerce in turning creator traffic into meaningful brand commerce metrics, and how any sized program can still make sure to focus on last-mile CVR. With a 30% lift in CVR, a 78% increase in AOV, and a stronger sense of community, the brand proved that when the shopping journey reflects the people it serves, both impact and revenue grow.
