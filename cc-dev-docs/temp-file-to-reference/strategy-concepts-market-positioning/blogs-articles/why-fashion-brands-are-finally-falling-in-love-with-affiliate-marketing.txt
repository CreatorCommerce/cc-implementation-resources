Why fashion brands are finally falling in love with affiliate marketing

Fashion brands are moving beyond discounts and embracing co-branded experiences, attracting more brands to referral marketing. This shift lets affiliates offer curated collections and styled fits, enhancing brand integrity and creating a more authentic shopping experience.


Word-of-mouth has always been king. But this year, we're witnessing a significant evolution of this powerful strategy, with affiliates, influencers, and customer advocates taking center stage. More than just a buzzword, word-of-mouth marketing is entering a new phase, and it’s reshaping how brands connect with their audience.

Customers as Affiliates: A Game-Changer for Brands
One of the driving forces behind this shift is the increasing trend of turning everyday customers into brand affiliates. Thanks to companies like Social Snowball, this approach is gaining traction and proving to be a major win for businesses. By making it easier to recruit and incentivize customers, these companies have created a massive opportunity for brands to expand their reach through genuine recommendations.

‍

But there’s another significant factor at play: the entry of an industry that has historically been resistant to referrals and discounts — fashion.

‍

Breaking Down Barriers in the Fashion Industry
For years, fashion brands faced a critical dilemma: they could offer referral discounts to encourage new customers, or they could uphold strict price integrity to maintain the brand’s prestige. The fear was that offering discounts could cheapen the brand’s image and undermine its perceived value.

‍

However, this trade-off is starting to disappear, thanks to co-branded referral experiences. These experiences allow brands to work closely with affiliates and influencers to create curated collections that add value beyond just a discount. Instead of merely promoting lower prices, these affiliates now present personalized recommendations, curated fits, and styled collections that align with the brand’s image.

From Discounts to Curation: A New Value Proposition
For a referral program to be truly effective, affiliates need to be able to add real value to the customer experience. While discounts were the primary driver of referrals in the past, today’s affiliates are empowered to offer more. Co-branded referral experiences allow affiliates to showcase curated collections, “Get Ready With Me” (GRWM) videos, and fit guides for specific events or occasions — all while maintaining the brand’s integrity.

‍

This shift in strategy has been validated over the last few years with LTK (formerly LIKEtoKNOW.it), where creators were given the tools to share and sell curated collections. But the trend is taking an even more exciting turn with platforms like CreatorCommerce. By giving brands the power to collaborate closely with creators, CreatorCommerce is enabling completely unique and brand-focused experiences that are highly tailored to the audience.

‍

The Future of Experiential and Inspirational Shopping
Imagine shopping experiences where influencers and affiliates go beyond mere endorsements. They create starter packs, guide you through event-specific fits, and inspire your wardrobe with curated looks for special occasions. These experiences are becoming the norm, and they’re making shopping more experiential and inspirational than ever.

‍

This evolution of word-of-mouth marketing is setting the stage for a more immersive, value-driven shopping experience. With the rise of co-branded collaborations and the power of platforms like Social Snowball and CreatorCommerce, brands are no longer faced with the same old trade-off of price integrity vs. referrals. Instead, they’re embracing a future where customers, affiliates, and influencers work together to create something truly special.
