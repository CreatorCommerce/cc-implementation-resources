24 co-branded landing page tips (Inspired by highest-converting tactics)

If you’re a brand building co-branded Shopify funnels using CreatorCommerce, you already know the value of creators: their voice, their trust, and their loyal audiences. But how do you turn a click from an influencer’s link into a high-converting customer experience? We took inspiration from Nik Sharma’s legendary landing page playbook and adapted it specifically for co-branded influencer funnels built with CreatorCommerce. These 24 tips will help you personalize your pages, increase conversions, and build love from both creators and customers.

1. Feature Real Creator Social Proof
Forget generic testimonials and polished celeb ads. Instead, use UGC from the actual creator who referred the traffic. Better yet, include a quote from their follower who used the product. Authenticity > polish.

“I saw @fitmomkelly use this, and it’s been a game-changer for my mornings!”
‍

2. Punchy, Creator-Aligned Copy Wins
Your copy should sound like the creator — their words, their tone. Replace stale value props with benefit-driven, emotional copy that bridges their lifestyle with your product.

Instead of “Hydrating formula,” try:
“@wellnessjane’s glow-up secret — one scoop a day.”
‍

3. Design Mobile-First, Always
80–90% of your traffic is mobile, especially from influencers. Design with vertical scroll in mind. Place the creator front and center: name, photo, quote, and offer — all before the first swipe.

‍

4. Make Pricing + Discounts POP
Use bold fonts, bright colors, stickers, or creator badges. And tie it to the creator’s offer.

“@coachchad fans get 20% off — this week only!”
Also, add pricing per use: “Just $0.80/day with Chad’s Stack.”
‍

5. Tell Visual Stories
Lifestyle photos > product photos. Use creator UGC, unboxings, and side-by-side results. Show the creator’s life with the product. Add graphs or visuals where needed.

‍

6. Turn Pop-Ups into VIP Access
Use pop-ups to gate exclusive offers or early access tied to the creator.

“Get @plantmomma’s exclusive starter kit + 10% off — drop your email!”
Start simple with just email. Ask for more later.

‍

7. Design for Accessibility
Make your landing pages ADA-compliant. That means high-contrast text, readable fonts, alt text for images (especially creator photos), and an inclusive layout. Respect your full audience.

‍

8. Simplify Checkout Around the Creator
Keep checkout to two clicks. Preload the creator’s curated product or bundle. Reiterate the creator’s quote at checkout:

“This is the one I use every day — you’ll love it.”
‍

9. Put the Best Offer First
Lead with your top offer — especially if it’s creator-exclusive.

“@jessfan’s 27% off ends in 24 hours!”
Use urgency and exclusivity.

‍

10. Use a Comparison Chart
Add a side-by-side comparison with other options or competitors — and stamp the creator’s pick.

“Why @drdave recommends this stack over others”
Add emojis, checkmarks, and creator quotes.

‍

11. Polish Your UI — Like the Creator Would
Design your landing page with the creator’s aesthetic. If their IG is minimal and pastel, your landing page shouldn’t be neon chaos. Match tone, vibe, and visual branding.

‍

12. Remove Buyer’s Remorse
Answer common post-purchase questions with creator-backed assurance.

“Ships in 24 hours — and yes, @glowupgirl approved the return policy too.”
‍

13. Show What’s Inside (Literally)
Use an unboxing video from the creator, or a photo showing exactly what’s in the box.

“@muscledan’s gym bag includes: [product list]”
Make it tactile and real.

‍

14. Enable Buy Now, Pay Later
Add ShopPay Installments or other BNPL options. Reassure shoppers by pairing it with the creator:

“Pay later with ShopPay — just like @ecoelle does.”
‍

15. Use Smart Font Hierarchy
Break up the page with clear headers and varied text sizes. Example:

H1: “@fitchefemma’s #1 kitchen must-have”
H2: “Better digestion in 7 days”
Quote: “I haven’t missed a morning since!”
Guide the eye visually.

‍

16. Highlight Benefit-Focused Quotes
Use real quotes that speak to transformation, not features.

Instead of: “Tastes great”

‍
Use: “I feel energized, clear-headed, and lighter after using this every morning — thanks @plantmomma!”
‍

17. Use Heatmaps + Watch Sessions
Tools like Heatmap.com and Clarity can show where people fall off. Use this to test which creator UGC works best, how far users scroll, and what content they’re engaging with.

‍

18. Merchandise Like a Creator-Curated Shelf
Use a Creator’s Picks section. Think of it like a physical endcap at Target. Put their top product first, followed by their secondaries, with creator quotes in between.

‍

19. Say More With Fewer Words
Let creators and their videos do the talking. Replace 5-line product blocks with 10-second reels and punchy headers:

“One scoop. One week. One glow-up.”
‍

20. Make Limited-Time Offers Feel Real
Use timers and urgent copy — only if it’s real.

“Ends tonight @midnight. @jessfan’s discount disappears!”
Keep it honest to stay FTC-compliant.

‍

21. Dumb It Down (In a Good Way)
If your grandma or a third grader can’t understand the page in 5 seconds, it’s too complicated. Simplify:

“1. Tap the product. 2. Checkout. 3. Glow up.”
‍

22. Include a Creator-Centric FAQ
Use an FAQ section that feels personal.

“@drdave’s most common Qs”
Make answers conversational and creator-endorsed.

‍

23. Load Lightning-Fast
Use optimized UGC and don’t overload the page with large creator videos. Use lazy-loading where needed. Pages should load in under 1 second, especially from IG Stories and TikToks.

‍

24. Test. Test. Then Test Again.
Make multiple versions of creator funnels. Try different:

Creator headlines
UGC styles
Bundle offers
Price presentations
‍

Run A/B tests on the same traffic source and double down on what works.
