How Cozy Earth's creator co-branded shopping funnels turned fandom into fanatics (and a 214% increase in CVR)
Cozy Earth isn’t a brand that struggles to attract attention. Known for its premium, eco-conscious loungewear, it has always had a natural affinity with major personalities and influencers. But like many fast-growing DTC brands, Cozy Earth wanted to keep pushing the bar to stand out from the crowd. Engagement was still strong, but their Shopify storefront wasn't backing up the collaborations they were working so hard to stand up.

The Shift: From Codes to Experiences
Promo Codes Were Starting to Fail Cozy Earth
For a long time, Cozy Earth relied on a tried-and-true strategy: influencer promo codes. It was easy to track, easy to share, and during the brand’s initial growth phase, it worked. Creators would mention a code on social, and sales would follow.

‍

But like most fast-growing brands, Cozy Earth's little problems with that model became bigger problems. The weaknesses of a code-first strategy became increasingly difficult to ignore:

Code leaks were undermining exclusivity and eroding margins.
Attribution was murky, especially as multiple creators reached overlapping audiences.
The customer journey lacked context, sending shoppers to generic pages with little connection to the creator who drove the traffic.
Creativity was limited. A five-character code doesn’t tell a story or build a moment.
‍

At a time when Cozy Earth needed to differentiate and go deeper with fans, codes began to feel like a shallow tool. The influencer channel was starting to look like just another affiliate channel: without the premium experience Cozy Earth is known for.

‍

The Solution: From Discount Distribution to Experience Design
Cozy Earth partnered with CreatorCommerce to flip the model.

‍

Instead of relying on creators to hand out codes, the brand empowered them with co-branded landing pages that lead into co-branded product page—personalized digital storefronts that extended the creator’s identity into the buying experience.

‍




‍

Each landing page was carefully curated to feel like a collaboration between the creator and the brand. These were more than just pages. They were destinations.

Here’s what they included:

Hand-picked product selections aligned with the creator’s persona or preferences
Auto-applied discounts that removed friction and increased urgency
Creator visuals and content, building trust and familiarity
Mobile-optimized layouts that made shopping smooth and immersive‍
Full-funnel strategy that supported product reviews on product pages & discounts everywhere on the them
Product pages loaded with CVR potential with added quotes, content and testimonials from the creator
‍


‍

The result? Fans weren’t just clicking. They were staying, browsing, buying. The page wasn’t just a means to get a discount: it became a reason to convert.

‍

The Strategic Payoff
Switching to link-based experiences brought a wave of benefits. First, attribution became clean and reliable. Cozy Earth could directly track which creators were driving sales, not just traffic. That allowed them to optimize their program with confidence. Setting the stage for severl new experiences the Cozy team is working on testing furether.

‍

Second, the brand gained more control. Offers could be fine-tuned per creator. Pages could be updated in real time. Campaigns could evolve without waiting on new codes or worrying about leaks.

Link adoption by revenue in the first 4 months (Shifting over from codes)
‍

But perhaps most importantly, Cozy Earth was finally giving its influencer partners the environment they deserved: a premium experience that mirrored the quality of both the product and the people promoting it.

‍

"CreatorCommerce is amazing to work with. Their custom Influencer landing pages are seamless, and their data and cookie tracking is some of the best I’ve seen in the industry. We at Cozy Earth have been using them for about a year, and are so excited to continue working together!"
