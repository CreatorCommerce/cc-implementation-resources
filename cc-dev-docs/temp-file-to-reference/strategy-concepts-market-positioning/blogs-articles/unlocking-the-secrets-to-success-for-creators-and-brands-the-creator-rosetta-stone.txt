Unlocking the Secrets to Success for Creators and Brands: The Creator Rosetta Stone

The Creator Rosetta Stone, a collaborative research project by The Harris Poll and Creator Vision, reveals key communication gaps between brands and creators, offering essential insights for more effective and meaningful partnerships in the creator economy.


The Creator Rosetta Stone, a groundbreaking research project by The Harris Poll and Creator Vision just dropped & is absolutely worth a read. This study dives deep into the communication barriers that often hinder effective partnerships, revealing how brands can better understand and connect with creators. As brands strive to harness the power of influencer marketing, this research provides essential insights for fostering more meaningful and productive relationships.

‍

Some of the major themes that we felt others should walk away with are:

‍

The Big Communication Fail
Did you know 85% of creators never get feedback from brands? That’s a lot of missed opportunities to make content better. Brands need to start talking more with creators to see real improvements.

‍

Community is Not Just an Audience
Brands often confuse "community" with "audience." But for creators, a community is interactive and engaged, not just a bunch of passive viewers. It’s about building real connections.

‍

Real Diversity, Not Just a Checkbox
When creators talk about diversity, they mean real, authentic representation. It’s not just about ticking boxes but reflecting genuine diversity within their communities.

‍

Partners, Not Just Talent
Creators don’t want to be seen as mere talent. They see themselves as partners who understand their audience inside out. Collaboration should be about mutual respect and leveraging each other’s strengths.

‍

Meaning Over Trends
Forget about chasing every trend. Creators value meaningful, longform content that truly resonates with their audience. It’s about creating something that lasts.

‍

Seamless Shopping Experiences
Brands are losing sales because of poor coordination between content and checkout. Making e-commerce integration smooth can boost sales and keep customers happy.
