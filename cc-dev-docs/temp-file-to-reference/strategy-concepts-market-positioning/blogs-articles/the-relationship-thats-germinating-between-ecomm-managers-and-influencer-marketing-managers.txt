The relationship that's 🌱 germinating between eComm Managers and Influencer Marketing Managers


An exciting new priority is starting to bloom for eCommerce Managers—one that's all about breaking down walls and teaming up closely with influencer marketing departments. 🌱

Traditionally, influencer marketing teams have been laser-focused on nurturing relationships with creators, cranking out engaging content, and driving traffic to online stores. While it seems obvious they’d care about what happens once a shopper clicks that influencer's link, this important "after-click" experience typically falls outside their day-to-day responsibilities and KPIs. Instead, optimizing this critical part of the customer journey is squarely in the hands of the eCommerce team.

‍

Historically speaking, eCommerce managers have spent most of their energy (and budgets) on performance marketing channels—think paid search (SEM), social ads, and display campaigns. Influencer marketing? It often sat on the sidelines, quietly contributing less than 5% of total website traffic and understandably getting overlooked in the hustle for quick returns.

‍

But things have changed—big time.

‍

Today, a growing number of brands are seeing influencer, affiliate, and word-of-mouth channels drive over 20% of their new customer acquisitions. Influencer traffic has shifted from being the forgotten, dried-out houseplant tucked away in your guest bathroom to becoming the dazzling 🎄 Christmas tree right in the center of your living room. Give it regular attention, fresh water, and some decorations, and it will deliver plenty of gifts (in the form of loyal customers and revenue) over time.

‍

This new reality sets the stage for eCommerce managers to step into "hero-mode." To seize the opportunity, eCommerce teams need to start actively collaborating with influencer marketers—not just casually, but strategically—to enhance the full customer experience and boost conversions.

‍

Of course, no one wants extra work piled on their already full plates. The secret to managing this without drowning in tasks is finding the right technology. That’s exactly why CreatorCommerce was built. CreatorCommerce acts as the ultimate wingman for both eCommerce and influencer teams, bridging the gap and making teamwork effortless.

‍

With seamless integrations into Shopify’s Liquid templating system and full compatibility with Shopify’s extensive app ecosystem, CreatorCommerce lets you dynamically personalize your storefront based on incoming affiliate traffic. It’s like magic: each visitor gets their own tailored experience, perfectly aligned with the influencer who brought them in. This dynamic personalization directly leads to happier shoppers, better conversion rates, and higher customer satisfaction.

‍

From an academic perspective, this approach taps into well-established theories around personalization and optimizing customer journeys. Research consistently shows personalized experiences outperform generic interactions, driving higher conversion rates, bigger basket sizes (AOV), and greater long-term customer value (LTV).

‍

But here’s the catch—achieving these impressive results depends on breaking down departmental silos. Organizations stuck in their silos miss out on the full potential of influencer traffic because their strategies remain fragmented. On the flip side, companies that encourage tight-knit collaboration between influencer and eCommerce teams consistently see stronger overall performance.

‍

CreatorCommerce helps facilitate this crucial teamwork by equipping eCommerce managers and influencer marketers with powerful tools to manage thousands of tailored funnels directly on their DTC websites. Every influencer link transforms into a personalized entryway, engaging visitors with contextually relevant shopping experiences.

The future of eCommerce is bright, collaborative, and personalized. Are your teams ready to seize this opportunity—and maybe even have a little fun along the way?
