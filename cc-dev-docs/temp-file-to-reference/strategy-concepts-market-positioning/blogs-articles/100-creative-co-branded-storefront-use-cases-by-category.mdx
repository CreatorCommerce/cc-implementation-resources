100 creative co-branded storefront use-cases (By category)

Co-branded storefronts are more than a feature in your tech stack. They’re a strategic weapon - a way to wrap your products in the story, authority, and influence of someone else. Whether that’s a creator, an ambassador, a B2B partner, or even a community leader, the real magic happens when you think in outcomes: What do you want your audience to do, feel, or believe after landing on this page?

We’ve compiled 100 creative use-cases we’ve seen work — organized by category — so you can stop guessing and start designing storefronts with intent.
