Shopify order & customer tagging reference
CreatorCommerce automatically applies specific tags to orders and customers in your Shopify store, making it easier to run reports, filter orders, and identify creator-driven performance at a glance. This guide outlines the tags that CreatorCommerce uses and shows how you can leverage them in Shopify’s reporting and customer account management.


Overview
When a sale is attributed to a particular creator or campaign via CreatorCommerce, tags are appended to the corresponding Shopify order, to the customer account who made the purchase, and to the customer account (that belongs to the creator). These tags allow you to track:

Which creator drove the sale (and thus the revenue)
Which campaign that creator sale belongs to
Creator-sourced customers over time (for analyzing new customers or re-purchasers)
By using Shopify’s native tagging system, you can perform custom searches, create smart collections, or pull specialized reports—all without leaving your Shopify admin.

Order Tags
CreatorCommerce adds the following tags to orders:

cc-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb
Represents the unique ID of the creator who drove the sale.
The segment after cc-creator-id- (e.g., 66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb) is a placeholder example ID. Each creator will have a unique identifier.
cc-campaign-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb
Reflects the unique ID of the campaign with which the creator is associated.
Useful for filtering or reporting on sales from a specific campaign.
CreatorCommerce
A simple, human-readable tag for quick filtering or searching in Shopify’s Orders page.

Also accessible as order attributes
CreatorCommerce also applies order tag data in the form of cart attributes as a backup lookup method. However, it is the same data that is tagged.

Why Order Tags Are Useful
Quick Filter in Shopify Admin: Go to Orders, type in tag:CreatorCommerce (or the relevant creator/campaign tag) to see all orders driven by that affiliation.
Reporting: Pull revenue-per-campaign or revenue-per-creator metrics by filtering your orders with these tags.
Fulfillment & Internal Processes: If you have special workflows for orders generated by affiliates, you can trigger those workflows using the tag logic.
‍

Customer Tags
CreatorCommerce also tags customers in Shopify:

cc-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb
Denotes which creator brought that customer’s initial purchase.
This tag remains on the customer record, making it easier to identify any customers that are creators.
cc-referred-from-creator-id-66c35503bb33ccae069f43bb‍
Denotes which creator the customer has purchased from.
This tag remains on the customer record, making it easier to track lifetime purchases and new customers back to a specific creator.


‍

Why Customer Tags Are Useful
New vs. Returning Customers: Quickly see how many new customers a creator has driven.
Lifetime Value (LTV): Filter customers by their cc-referred-from-creator-id tag to evaluate total spend from that creator’s referrals.
Segmented Marketing: If you want to reward or communicate differently with customers from a certain creator, you can use customer tags to build segments or run email campaigns.
‍

Reporting & Analysis
With order and customer tags in place, you can do more advanced analysis in Shopify (or export the data to a BI tool) such as:

New Customer Counts Per Creator: Look at customer tags for each cc-referred-from-creator-id to see how many new customers were brought in by that creator.
Lifetime Value Per Creator: Filter your customer list by the same cc-referred-from-creator-id tag and use Shopify’s LTV calculations or external analysis.
Revenue Per Campaign: Filter orders by a specific cc-campaign-id-xxxxxx tag to see total sales under that campaign.
Re-Engagement Campaigns: If you know which customers came from a certain creator, you can target them with special promotions or re-marketing.
‍

Implementation Details
Automatically Applied by CreatorCommerce: You don’t need to configure anything manually to attach these tags if the CreatorCommerce SDK is set up correctly. The tags appear once an order is processed for a shopper who arrived via an affiliate/creator link.
Persistence: The customer tag remains even if they make subsequent purchases without using the affiliate link, ensuring you can still attribute their lifetime value to the original creator.
Editable in Shopify: While tags are automatically added, you can still manually edit or remove tags in Shopify if needed. However, be cautious not to remove tags that are key to your reporting workflows.
‍

Conclusion
CreatorCommerce’s Shopify tagging system for orders and customers provides clear, native visibility into which creators and campaigns are driving results. By leveraging these tags, you can:

Effortlessly filter and generate reports on revenue per creator, revenue per campaign, and new vs. returning customers.
Integrate seamlessly with your store’s fulfillment, customer service, or marketing workflows.
Gain quick insights into which collaborations perform best, all within Shopify’s familiar interface.
Whether you need a quick at-a-glance check on affiliate-driven orders or an in-depth LTV analysis, these tags unlock powerful custom reporting use-cases, helping you optimize and scale your CreatorCommerce collaborations.
