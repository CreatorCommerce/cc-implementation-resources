Affiliate link tracking reference
This is a technical guide on how CreatorCommerce manages affiliate link redirects to preserve the tracking integrity of all relevant tools. The outcome of this practice is bulletproof attribution that bundles CreatorCommerce's tracking methods along with those of its affiliate partners.


You can use existing or newly created affiliate links, and CreatorCommerce will seamlessly add its own tracking parameters to those links, preserving all original affiliate tracking data and appending CreatorCommerce’s tracking details.

‍

How tracking works
Affiliate Link Click‍
When a user clicks on an existing affiliate link generated by your affiliate platform, CreatorCommerce captures the tracking parameters included in the link. CreatorCommerce does this by taking over the redirect, and by pushing traffic to a CreatorCommerce endpoint so that it can round all tracking solutions into a single URL.
Tracking Parameter Preservation
Affiliate Platform Parameters: CreatorCommerce does not modify or remove the original parameters from your affiliate platform.
Additional CreatorCommerce Parameter: CreatorCommerce appends its own tracking parameter (e.g., cc={{tracking-handle-for-creatorcommerce}}) to the URL.
Redirect & Combined URL‍
As a result, the final URL typically resembles: https://your-brand.com?{{tracking-stuff-from-your-affiliate-platform}}&cc={{tracking-handle-for-creatorcommerce}}
Note: The exact delimiter between parameters (? vs. &) may vary based on your existing links.‍
Attribution‍
CreatorCommerce Tracking: The appended parameter ensures CreatorCommerce can track the user through the purchase funnel.
Affiliate Platform Tracking: Original affiliate parameters remain intact, so the affiliate platform also attributes the purchase correctly.

Requirements
CreatorCommerce SDK Enabled on Shopify‍
You must have the CreatorCommerce SDK installed and enabled on your Shopify theme. This is crucial for CreatorCommerce to properly track user activity once they land on your site.
Active Affiliate Platform Link‍
Your affiliate platform must generate a valid link containing its tracking parameters. CreatorCommerce then appends additional parameters to that link.
URL Tracking Support‍
Since CreatorCommerce relies on URL-based parameters to track attribution, your site (and any affiliate platform) should support parameterized URLs for tracking.
‍

Important Details
CreatorCommerce Does Not Manage Third-Party Scripts:
While CreatorCommerce preserves and passes along affiliate tracking parameters, it does not maintain or interact with the tracking scripts from your affiliate partners. Those scripts need to be managed directly in your Shopify theme or via your affiliate network’s prescribed installation method.
Affiliate Link Format:
The affiliate link might already have parameters in place (e.g., ?affid=123). CreatorCommerce will add its own parameter (&cc=xyz) without altering existing data.
Multiple Parameters:
You may see more parameters when the affiliate link includes multiple pieces of data (e.g., affiliate ID, campaign ID, etc.). CreatorCommerce will simply chain its parameter in the URL.
‍

Example
Original Affiliate Link: https://your-brand.com?affid=abc123&source=affiliate‍
Appended by CreatorCommerce: https://your-brand.com?affid=abc123&source=affiliate&cc={{creatorcommerce-id}}‍
Tracking Experience:‍
Affiliate Platform sees affid=abc123 and source=affiliate as originally intended.
‍

Troubleshooting & Best Practices
Ensure SDK Installation‍
Double-check that the CreatorCommerce SDK is properly installed on your Shopify theme. Without it, CreatorCommerce cannot track user events.
Test Your Affiliate Links
Manual Test: Click your newly generated affiliate link to see if it redirects correctly and maintains parameters in the URL.
Confirm Data: Verify in your CreatorCommerce dashboard (and affiliate partner dashboards) that clicks and conversions are being recorded.
Parameter Conflicts‍
If you see any unexpected changes to your URL parameters, consult your affiliate platform’s documentation to ensure that there’s no automatic rewriting of parameters. CreatorCommerce’s standard approach simply appends parameters and shouldn’t conflict with typical affiliate tracking.
Maintain Script Integrations‍
Your affiliate partner may require placing a script or pixel on your site for tracking. Confirm that these scripts are in place and functioning—especially if you make theme changes.
‍

Summary
By appending its own parameter to existing affiliate links, CreatorCommerce ensures that both CreatorCommerce and your affiliate platform capture the necessary attribution data. This setup provides reliable tracking for co-branded shopping funnels without requiring you to alter existing affiliate links. Simply ensure that:

Your affiliate platform links are active and valid.
The CreatorCommerce SDK is installed on your Shopify theme.
You maintain any required scripts for your affiliate platform.
With this configuration, your affiliate partners’ conversions will continue to be attributed accurately, and CreatorCommerce’s tracking will seamlessly integrate for a robust, end-to-end tracking experience.
