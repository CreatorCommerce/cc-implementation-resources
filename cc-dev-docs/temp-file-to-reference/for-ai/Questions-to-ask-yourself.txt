How AI can work with a user to think about and dissect their program for CreatorCommerce




🎯 How to Present to the Client: Deep Discovery Framework
As CC gets past low-hanging partner sales in good time, this discovery framework is meant to open up a merchant, especially one who has problems, but not yet seeing where CC can solve them.
Step 0: Salesmanship (The Basics)
Before we get to the meat of discovery, we need to setup (or even closeout) convos to make sure we are ready to talk cheese, or to make sure we get to a convo where we are able to talk cheese.
Opening Frame:

IF WE PROSPECTED THEM
So obviously I reached out to you with some concepts I’m passionate about for you. So if you don’t mind, I don’t want to leave you guessing, transparently, do you mind if I tell you what I’m building and what I was thinking about for BRAND?
So we’re CreatorCommerce, we help brands from Crocs to Cozy Earth spin up commerce experiences back up their collabs with influencers, ambassadors, B2B affiliates etc. With the flagship offering being co-branded storefronts for every single collab, but that’s now also scaling into co-branded email, co-branded pop-ups, asset generation, etc etc.
As brands look more & more to performance based word-of-mouth growth, our platform is working towards the answer to the question: after you put all this time & effort into your program, how do you actually get the most out of the ROI of your collabs?
We care really only about 3 things: building towards better metrics, memorable moments, and a sustainable moat.
Closing Frame (Setting up to be able to get somewhere):
Look I know you could probably be doing anywhere from 5 to 50 other things right now so I appreciate you jumping on. How can I return the favor and make this the best call you’ve had today, what’s been going on with BRAND in the world of collabs?
Step 1: Discovery (The Real Conversation)
Opening Frame:
"I want to understand where you are, where you want to go, and what's actually working right now. This isn't about selling you a tier — it's about building the right infrastructure for your specific reality."

Current State Assessment 
Try to glean as much as possible on:
Scale & Performance:
How many creators/affiliates/influencers are you working with now?
How much creator-driven revenue are you doing annually?
What percentage of total revenue does that represent?
Which affiliate/partners have you served best? As in, who are you really resonating with?
Follow-up: What makes those relationships work? What do they get from you that they can't get elsewhere?
Follow-up: What tools or resources would make them even stickier? What's the one thing they wish they had from you?
Capacity & Resources:
Do you have a team to execute campaigns?
How much time are you spending managing creators vs. strategizing with them?
What's eating up your time that shouldn't be?
Are you currently doing any seeding, packaging, or gifting programs? What's that process like?
Commitment Level:
Is this a test, a growth channel, or your core business model?
What does crushing year-end goals look like right now?
Follow-up: How much of that depends on creator/affiliate performance?
Follow-up: What would need to happen in Q4 to make this year a win?

Strategic Direction
Growth Vector:
Which direction are you trying to grow? Lean into the affiliates/partners who already love you, or break into newer affiliate markets?
Follow-up: If leaning in — what would 3x-ing that segment look like?
Follow-up: If breaking new ground — who's the dream partner profile you haven't cracked yet?
Brand Positioning:
What product dimensions do you want to own? What's the brand's big picture?
How do you want consumers to view you as a brand, vendor, or marketplace looking ahead?
Follow-up: Does your current creator ecosystem reflect that vision, or is there a gap?
If someone discovers you through a creator, what experience do you want them to have?
How active are you with capturing momentum on social trends? Is your finger on the trigger?
Defensibility:
What would make your best creators impossible to poach?
If a competitor launched tomorrow with the same partnerships, what would keep your creators loyal?
(This reveals whether they understand moats at all)
What do your creators need from you that they can't build themselves?

Seasonal & Campaign Rhythm
Current Calendar:
What does your annual calendar look like right now? Any major seasonal moments or product drops?
Which seasons or quarters are most important for your business?
Follow-up: Is that when you do the most revenue, or when you need the most momentum?
Do you have any big cultural moments you lean into? (holidays, back-to-school, wellness reset, etc.)
Campaign History:
What's a campaign or collaboration that really worked? What made it special?
What's one you tried that fell flat? Why do you think it didn't land?
Have you done any experiential drops, co-branded moments, or limited releases?
Follow-up: How did creators show up for those? What would've made it easier for them?
Untapped Moments:
Are there seasonal opportunities you've wanted to lean into but haven't had the capacity?
What about reactive or trend-jacking moments? Do you have the infrastructure to move fast when something pops culturally?
If you could create one "signature moment" that becomes your brand's annual thing, what would it be?

Creator Experience & Tools
What They Need:
How are you finding, attracting & activating the right talent?
What problems do your creators consistently face? (sourcing content, finding the right products, tracking performance, etc.)
Do they need curation tools to build their own collections?
Would content tools help them? (image generation, mood boards, outfit builders, quizzes, mini-games)
Do they need booking widgets, calendars, or RSVP functionality for events?
Are they running their own businesses where deeper integration with your platform would help? (RX tools, business info ingestion, custom dashboards)
How are you running ads with partners today?
Current Pain Points:
What questions do your creators ask you most often?
Where do they get stuck in working with you?
Do they understand how they're performing? Do you understand how they're performing?
What would make onboarding new creators 10x easier?

Pain Points & Aspirations
What's Broken:
What's the most frustrating part of managing creators right now?
Where are you losing money, time, or momentum in the current setup?
Are you able to attribute customer purchases back to specific creators? Do you know which creators drive repeat purchases?
Can you personalize the customer experience based on how they discovered you?
What's Possible:
If you could wave a magic wand, what would your creator ecosystem look like in 12 months?
What would free you up to focus on the most important aspects: relationships with your VIPs, creative strategy, brand building?
What does "collaboration at scale" mean to you? What's the version of that you actually want?
If your creators had their own white-labeled storefronts that felt like theirs but were built on your platform — what would that unlock?
The Big Vision:
Three years from now, what role do creators play in your business?
If you could profitably put paid behind every creator going forward, would you be willing to work towards that strategy?
Do you want to help your top creators build bigger, deeper brands of their own — always built on your product platform?
What would make this feel less like "influencer marketing" and more like "we're building something together"?

Seasonal Campaign Deep Dive Questions
Use these to map intensity and relevance for each potential campaign type:
Q1: Reset/Wellness
Do you have products that fit into January reset or wellness narratives?
Would mood boards, playlists, or content generation tools support this?
Is this a big quarter for you, or more of a bridge period?
Q2: Sustainable/Local
Do you lean into sustainability, local sourcing, or community stories?
Would tools like booking widgets for local events or RSVP functionality help?
Are there regional creators you want to activate differently?
Q3: Experiential/Seasonal Drops
Do you do summer launches, back-to-school, or seasonal product releases?
Would custom seeding packaging, mini-games, or product generators enhance these moments?
Have you done (or wanted to do) pop-ups, in-person events, or creator meetups?
Q4: Viral Moonshots
Is Q4 your biggest revenue driver? (Most brands: yes)
Do you need to move fast on trends, or do you prefer planned campaigns?
Would quizzes, outfit randomizers, or sponsored image-gen tools make creator content more engaging?
What's your dream "this goes viral" moment for the holidays?
Year-Round:
Do you need always-on content tools that creators can use anytime? (curation, product customization, content libraries)
Would giving creators their own branded mini-experiences (mood boards, playlists, games) keep them engaged between big campaigns?

Step 2: Present the Package
Show them how the system solves their specific reality. Bring their preference on white-glove VS self-serve to bare here.
Frame it like this:
"Based on what you just told me — especially [repeat back their specific pain point or goal] — here's what I'd recommend:
You're at [X scale], you want to [grow/lean in/break into Y], and you need to free yourself up to focus on [relationships/creative/brand].
This isn't just a service package. It's the annual subscription that gets you all 10 points of the Moat System at the depth you actually need to win. Here's what that looks like for you..."
Then walk through THEIR version:
Point 0: Define Who We Are Collabing With
“Who are these people, what is their motivation, what is their pitch, and what is their traffic-gen process?”
Point 1: Define Your Moat Metrics
"For your brand, we'd track [specific metrics they mentioned — creator GMV, repeat rate, viral multiplier]..."
Point 2: Identify the Moat Builders
"You mentioned [specific creator type] really resonates. We'd build tools specifically for them — [curation tools/content tools/booking widgets] — so they feel like they're building on your platform, not just promoting products."
“We can also think about how to capture & convert other affiliates who see these pages to make a recruitment flywheel”
Point 3: Design Moments That Matter
"Based on your calendar, here's what I'm thinking: [map their seasonal moments to campaign types]"
Q1: [Reset campaign with mood boards/playlists]
Q2: [Local/sustainable with RSVP/booking tools]
Q3: [Experiential drop with custom seeding]
Q4: [Viral moonshot with quizzes/games]
"These aren't just campaigns — they're the moments your creators look forward to and your customers remember."
Point 4: Build the Evergreen Funnel Per Tier/Segment
"Between campaigns, creators need always-on tools. Based on what you said, we'd build [specific tools they need]."
“How does this change by collab tier?”
“What is the story they tell and funnel to express for each?”
Point 5: Elevate Platform/Program Positioning for Recruitment
"You want consumers to see you as [their vision]. We'd white-label everything so it feels like your platform, with that [Sephora-level/prestige/community] energy."
Emphasize this elevation in existing sign-up flow or launch new sign up funnels
Re-think emails / outbound strategy
Point 6: Launch Your Enablement Playbook
"Software if half the motion, we need to think about education and how we want to enable & activat ethe program in low or high touch means from emails, to asset production & mailers, to your dashboard UX”
Point 7: Layer in Win-backs & Retention
"When someone discovers you through [specific creator], we'd personalize their entire experience — emails, product recs, messaging — based on that."
Point 8: Orchestrate Signature Campaigns
"Those [2/4/6+] campaigns we mapped? We'd handle [design/execution/everything], and you'd approve the vision and show up for the big moments."
Point 9: Keep Iterating the Moat
"This doesn't stay static. We'd meet [monthly/weekly/daily] to optimize based on what's working."
Point 10: Elevate Your Winners
"Your top creators? We'd equip them with [QR codes, asset creation, custom storefronts] so they're building their own brands on your platform. They become impossible to poach."
Make it about them, not the features.

Step 3: Show the Math
ROI Calculation:
Current State:
You're doing $[X] in creator-driven revenue annually
You're spending [Y hours/week] managing this manually
You're paying [agency retainer/influencer platform fees/etc.]
Potential Impact:
Industry standard: Brands with proper creator infrastructure see 3-5x growth in creator GMV within 12 months
For you, that means going from $[X] to $[X × 3-5] = $[potential revenue]
Incremental revenue: $[delta]
Investment:
Subscription cost: $[tier amount]/year
Monthly: $[monthly]/month (less than one senior marketer's salary)
ROI: [potential revenue ÷ subscription cost]x return

The Real Comparison:
Option 1: Build it yourself - Pro Plan
We’ll hold your hand, but it sounds like you’re a great fit for everything we have out of the box on our Pro plan.
Timeline: 1 week to build & test, even a day if ready to move
Risk: Low
Option 2: Deep Collaboration - Moat Maker (Base Rates)
Let’s work together to pull off your unique vision
What you get: Custom design, dev, on-going hands-on support, deep training, etc etc
What you don't get: All-in day-today management, un-capped & un-scoped on-going dev
Option 3: Managed Service - Custom Quote
$[tier amount]/year for complete infrastructure + ongoing management
Timeline: 60-90 days to ramp
You own the platform (white-labeled as your brand asset)
We align on every single detail, and own your eComm tech stack for all collabs, and bring in partners to fill in all the gaps

The Freedom Equation:
"Here's what this really buys you: time and safety.
This is what leading brands are already doing, in droves. While you’re implementation is going to be highly innovative, this strategy is well proven. This is the platform & tem leading here. Yes we’re a small team, yes we’re growing very quickly, and so yea I won’t lie and say we will be this collaborative and flexible to merchants in the future but that’s what we have right now.
Building relationships with your VIP creators
Designing the campaigns that become your mythology
Positioning your brand the way you described — as [their vision]
This subscription handles the infrastructure, the orchestration, the optimization. You get to focus on being creative, strategic, and building the partnerships that actually move the needle.
The platform becomes your asset. We're just the team & tool that keeps it running and evolving."

Step 4: The Close
Ask the Commitment Question:
"Based on what we've talked about — your goals, your current state, where you want to be — does this feel like the right infrastructure to get you there?"
If yes:
"Great. Let's get you onboarded. First 60-90 days we're building your foundation, and by [specific date based on their year-end goals or seasonal moment], you'll have [specific outcome they mentioned] up and running."
If hesitation:
"What's the gap? Is it the investment, the timeline, or something about the approach?"
Address objection directly with their own words from discovery

🎯 The Underlying Message
You're not selling them software. You're not selling them hours.
You're selling them:
Freedom — to focus on strategy, creativity, and VIP relationships
Leverage — a platform that compounds and becomes defensible
Positioning — the ability to own the brand vision they described
Scale — infrastructure that supports 3-5x growth without breaking
Seasonality — campaigns that align with their calendar and compound year over year
The discovery isn't about qualifying them for a tier.
 It's about understanding their business, their calendar, their creators, and their vision well enough to show them exactly how this becomes their unfair advantage.
