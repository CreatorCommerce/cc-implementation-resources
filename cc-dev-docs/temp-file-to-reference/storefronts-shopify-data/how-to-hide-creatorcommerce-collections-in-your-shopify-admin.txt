How to hide CreatorCommerce collections on the Shopify admin collections page
When an affiliate makes a collection via CreatorCommerce, the platform will turn that into a new collection in your Shopify store. While this makes the affiliate's curation more portable across your storefront, it can lead to a clogged Shopify collections page in your admin dashboard. This guide covers cleaning that up.

When your affiliates create collections through CreatorCommerce, they’re automatically turned into real Shopify collections—making their curation visible across your store. But if you’re managing a lot of collabs, your Shopify Collections page can start looking like a dumping ground.

This guide shows you how to clean things up by tagging CreatorCommerce collections with a prefix and filtering them out (or into) separate views in your Shopify admin.

‍

✅ Step 1: Add a Prefix to CreatorCommerce Collections
First, make sure CreatorCommerce collections are easy to identify.

Log into your CreatorCommerce dashboard
Go to the Settings tab
Toggle on "Enable Collection Prefix"
This will automatically add CC // to the title of any collection created by CreatorCommerce.

‍


Naming your view
‍

Example:
Instead of Summer Picks by Ava, the collection will be titled CC // Summer Picks by Ava

‍

⚠️ Heads up: To keep your storefront clean, remove the prefix when displaying collection titles in your Liquid theme.
Use this:

{{ collection.title | remove: "CC // " }}
‍

🧹 Step 2: Hide CreatorCommerce Collections in Shopify Admin
Now let’s create a view in your Shopify admin that hides these collections.

Go to your Shopify Admin
Click Products → Collections
Click the "More filters" or "Create View" button (depending on your admin version)
Click Create View
Give the view a name like "Non-CreatorCommerce Collections"
In the filter, enter:
-"CC // "
Save the view
‍

Boom—your view now shows only your manually created or product-driven collections.

‍

🔍 Step 3: (Optional) Create a View to Only Show CreatorCommerce Collections
If you want to review or manage affiliate collections separately:

Go back to your Shopify Admin → Collections
Click Create View
Name it something like "Affiliate Collections"
Set the filter:
"CC // "
Save the view
‍

You now have clean, segmented views in your Shopify admin for better workflow and less clutter.


Example of correct setup
‍

🙌 Summary
Turn on the "Enable Collection Prefix" setting in CreatorCommerce
Use CC // to identify affiliate-generated collections
Filter Shopify views to hide or isolate those collections
Use | remove: "CC // " in Liquid to keep titles customer-friendly
This simple setup gives you full control over what you and your team see in the admin, while still enabling scalable creator curation.
