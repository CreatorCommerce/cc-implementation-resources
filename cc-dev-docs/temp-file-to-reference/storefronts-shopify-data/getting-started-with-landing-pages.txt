1 - Getting started with landing pages (Liquid)
This guide explains how to build affiliate landing pages using Shopify’s metaobject page templates. By leveraging metaobjects, you gain direct access to CreatorCommerce data (like a creator’s drops, recommended products, etc.)—all without needing extensive additional lookups. Follow the steps below to set up a reusable landing page template that can be applied across numerous campaigns.


Why use metaobject pages for landing pages?
Convenient Data Access‍
Metaobject pages automatically provide fields as metaobject.field. For instance, if your metaobject includes a title field, you can reference it in Liquid with {{ metaobject.title }}.
Scalable Template‍
Once you create a metaobject page template, you can reuse it for multiple creators, affiliates, or campaigns simply by changing the relevant metaobject data.
Flexibility‍
You can integrate standard Shopify sections (with drag-and-drop editing) or add custom Liquid/HTML sections for deeper customization—ideal for showcasing multiple product drops or building tailored “tabs” for each product category.
‍

Prerequisites
Enable "Sync data with Shopify"
Go to the CreatorCommerce dashboard > Settings > Switch "Sync data with Shopify" to enabled
Be aware that with this setting enabled, CreatorCommerce will create a collection in Shopify whenever a creator makes a drop (collection of products). these collections will contain the metafield seo.hidden with a value of 1 if you need to filter them out of any UI or search experiences.
1+ CreatorCommerce Affiliate Storefronts‍
Ensure you have at least one storefront, affiliate, and campaign set up in CreatorCommerce. If not, create a test affiliate and campaign to serve as a starting point.
Metaobject Configured
Confirm that your CreatorCommerce metaobject (e.g., “Creator”) is installed and configured in Shopify under Settings > Custom data. Note:
You can add your own fields to the metaobject.
Do not remove or modify CreatorCommerce-managed fields.
‍

Step-by-step: Setting up a metaobject page template
Access Your Theme‍
In Shopify, navigate to Online Store > Themes and select the theme you want to customize.
Create a New Template
Click Customize on your chosen theme.
From the dropdown at the top center of the Theme Editor, locate and select Creator.
Click Create template (or New template).
Assign a name for your new template (e.g., vip-template).
‍


Selecting a template
‍

Add Sections & Blocks
Use the drag-and-drop editor to add any existing sections you want (banner, image with text, etc.).
For dynamic text or images, use Shopify’s dynamic source menu to bind fields like metaobject.field_name.
Optional: Add or Edit Custom Code
If you need more flexibility (e.g., a custom loop of products), you can create or edit your own Liquid sections.
Place your custom sections in the template or reference them via render 'section-name' in your theme code.

Advanced example: Looping through creator drops & products
A common use case is showcasing multiple “drops” (collections or product sets) that a creator recommends. Below is a simplified code snippet illustrating how you can loop through each drop and render a product grid:

      <!-- Content shown within each tab -->
      <div class="tabbed-content">
        {% assign tabstyle = 'content active' %}
        {% for drop in metaobject['cc-creator-drops'].value %}
          <!-- Each tab's content is identified by its unique 'id' -->
          <div id="{{ drop.handle }}" class="{{ tabstyle }}">
            <!-- Drop Description -->
            <div class="title-wrapper{% if drop.title == blank %} title-wrapper--no-heading{% endif %} {{ section.settings.heading_alignment }}">
              <p class="drop-description">
                {{ drop.description }}
              </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Product Grid -->
            <div class="product-grid">
              {% for product in drop.products %}
                {% assign product = product %}
                {%- render 'product-card', product: product -%}
              {% endfor %}
            </div>
          </div>

          {% assign tabstyle = 'content' %}
        {% endfor %}
      </div>
Key Points in This Example
metaobject['cc-creator-drops'] fetches the array of drops from the metaobject.
Each “drop” contains its own products collection, which is iterated over to render product-card.
The tabstyle logic shows how you could alternate CSS classes for an active/inactive tab system.

Testing & previewing your landing page
Theme editor preview
In the Shopify Theme Editor, you can preview your new template to check layout, text, and overall styling.
Live preview
Visit [yourbrand].com/pages/creator/[handle] to see how the page looks in a live environment.
Replace [handle] with the actual creator handle you have set in CreatorCommerce.
SEO & URL path settings
Under Settings > Custom data > Creator, you can adjust the URL path (e.g., creator to something else), set custom SEO titles, and manage whether these pages are indexed by search engines.
If you prefer to hide these pages from search engines, update your robots.txt to exclude the /creator/ path (or your chosen path).
‍

Tips & best practices
Use dynamic fields liberally‍
Instead of hardcoding text or images, bind them to your metaobject’s fields for easy, no-code updates in the future.
Avoid editing CreatorCommerce-managed fields‍
You can add fields to the metaobject but do not remove or modify the default fields (e.g., cc-creator-drops), as they’re crucial for CreatorCommerce functionality.
Leverage reusability‍
Once your template is created, you can spawn new landing pages simply by creating new metaobject entries—each with unique data (drops, product recommendations, etc.)—that reference the same page template.
Customize with sections‍
For advanced visuals or interactive elements, you can create custom Liquid sections or modify existing ones, then add them to your landing page template.
Preview often‍
Always preview or test your pages (especially if you added custom code) to ensure everything renders correctly and no Liquid errors appear.
‍

Summary
By combining Shopify’s metaobject functionality with CreatorCommerce data fields, you can quickly spin up attractive, data-driven landing pages. The process involves:

Creating a metaobject page template under your theme.
Adding or editing sections (either through drag-and-drop or custom code).
Looping through data (like drops and products) to create dynamic, personalized experiences.
Testing & adjusting your URL path and SEO settings as needed.
With these steps, you can build and manage an unlimited number of affiliate-focused landing pages—each connected to a different creator, campaign, or product set—while minimizing repetitive setup.
