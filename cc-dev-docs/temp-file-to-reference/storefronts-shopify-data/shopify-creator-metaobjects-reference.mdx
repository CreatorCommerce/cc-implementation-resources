Shopify Creator metaobjects reference
CreatorCommerce provides real-time access to your affiliate data via Shopify Metaobjects. This extends your access to CreatorCommerce’s Creator Primitive concept, giving you greater ability to build shopping surfaces & business logic around affiliate collaborations. This functionality is available on the CreatorCommerce Pro Plan and up.

What you’ll learn
Learn how to access the Creator Primitive — a data structure that CreatorCommerce syncs with Shopify Metaobjects. What is the Creator Primitive? It’s an assortment of fields that contain everything CreatorCommerce knows about your affiliates: from products they recommend, to their media, to their bio.

‍

Ideal use-cases for working with the Creator metaobject is to pull data into dedicated landing pages for your affiliates, as well as other pages in the shopping funnel (such as product pages). 

‍

Reminder: This functionality is available on the CreatorCommerce Pro Plan and up.

‍

Enabling the sync
If you haven’t already, enable this feature by going to the CreatorCommerce dashboard > Brand Kit > Merchandising > enable “Sync data with Shopify” > then save.

‍

Please note that when enabled, CreatorCommerce will create a new collection anytime a creator makes a drop. These collections will be available to online sales channels, and will contain the collection metafield seo.hidden with the value of 1 so that you can filter these out of search or any other use-case.

‍

Shopify metaobjects 101
Shopify metaobjects are custom data structures that allow merchants to store and manage unique information beyond Shopify's default fields, such as custom product details, brand stories, or sizing charts. These metaobjects enable greater flexibility in tailoring storefronts to business needs, enhancing customer experience by offering more specific and dynamic content. They are especially useful for integrating with apps and providing detailed product information or personalized experiences.
