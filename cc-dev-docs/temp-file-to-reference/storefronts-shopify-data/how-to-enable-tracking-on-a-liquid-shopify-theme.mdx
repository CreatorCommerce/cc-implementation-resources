How to enable tracking on a Liquid Shopify theme
Before going live with an implementation on a Liquid site, you'll first want to ensure tracking is enabled. This guide includes all relevant tracking settings you may want enabled on your CreatorCommerce funnels.


Step 1: Enable the CreatorCommerce SDK
Enabling the SDK ensures that context on which affiliate a shopper clicked through to is passed throughout the theme. This allows your theme to be aware of the fact that a shopper is in a co-branded shopping funnel in the first place, and provides the basis for orders to be attributes to a creator & for UI to react accordingly.

Go to Shopify
Go to "Online Storefront"
Open your theme "Customize"
Select "App embeds" on the left-hand side
Find "CreatorCommerce SDK" in the list
Enable (Toggle to on)
Save the theme




Step 2: Enable the web pixel (Should already be on by default)
Head into your CC dashboard > Settings > Scrll to enable tracking pixel
