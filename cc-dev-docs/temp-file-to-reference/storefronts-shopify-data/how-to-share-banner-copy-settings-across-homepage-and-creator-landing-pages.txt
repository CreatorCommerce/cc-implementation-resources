How to Share banner & copy settings across homepage and creator landing pages
Maintaining a consistent brand story across your traditional Shopify homepage and Creator landing pages shouldn't mean duplicating effort every time you change a banner, update headline copy, or launch a new campaign. Yet for many merchants, that's exactly the reality—leading to wasted time, version control issues, and inconsistent shopper experiences.


Thankfully, Shopify’s Theme Settings paired with CreatorCommerce’s co-branded funnel architecture gives you a powerful workaround: you can define shared content in your Theme Settings panel and reference it across both your homepage and all creator landing pages—ensuring centralized control from a single source of truth.

‍

🧠 Why this matters
Without shared settings:

You’d have to update homepage banners and creator page banners separately.
Minor tweaks (like a copy update or seasonal image swap) require multiple theme edits.
Inconsistencies can creep in between your brand site and your co-branded influencer experiences.
‍

With shared Theme Settings:

Update once in your theme settings, and it reflects everywhere.
Easily swap hero images, CTAs, or shared copy during a drop or campaign launch.
Reduce dev work by creating a “top-down” architecture.
‍

🔧 How to Set This Up
1. Create a new Theme Setting group
In your Shopify theme (via the Shopify Theme Editor):

Go to Theme Settings → click the gear icon.
Scroll down and create a new group—call it something like: Home/creator landing pages
This will act as the shared config for all landing environments.

‍

2. Add your shared inputs
Inside this Theme Settings group, add the content you want to reuse across pages. Common examples:

Banner image: Upload a hero banner you want shown on both your homepage and creator pages.
Copy or Headlines: Add a text field for a shared H1 or supporting subtext.
Call-to-action label: Add a string input like “Shop Now” or “Discover More.”
CTA link: URL or page link you want to be consistent across both environments.
Example setup:

| Field     | Type         | Example Value                           |
| --------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Banner    | Image Picker | `072125-hp-hero-3.jpg`                  |
| Headline  | Text         | `Built for Movement, Designed for You.` |
| CTA Label | Text         | `Shop the Collection`                   |
| CTA Link  | URL          | `/collections/core-essentials`          |
‍

3. Reference the setting in your homepage and creator templates
In both your homepage and creator page Liquid templates or sections, reference the setting like this:

<img src="{{ settings.home_creator_landing_pages_banner | img_url: 'master' }}" alt="Hero banner" />
<h1>{{ settings.home_creator_landing_pages_headline }}</h1>
<a href="{{ settings.home_creator_landing_pages_cta_link }}">{{ settings.home_creator_landing_pages_cta_label }}</a>
‍

Make sure the setting IDs match what you’ve defined in your settings_schema.json file.

‍

4. Test on both pages
After saving, preview your main homepage and any CreatorCommerce-generated landing pages. The shared settings should render consistently.

To test:

Change the banner in Theme Settings → It should update both homepage and creator landing pages.
Edit the CTA copy → It should reflect globally.
‍

⚠️ Gotchas & Tips
Use logical naming in settings_schema.json so it’s clear these are shared inputs.
For truly creator-specific overrides, you can still layer in conditional logic in Liquid based on the page context (e.g. if creator_handle).
If you're not seeing updates, check if your creator templates are explicitly overriding the shared value—remove hardcoded values.
‍

🧪 Practical Example
Let’s say you want to run a back-to-school campaign with a new banner and CTA.

Instead of editing your homepage and 30+ creator funnels individually:

Go to Theme Settings → Home/creator landing pages
Swap the banner to BackToSchool_Hero.jpg
Change headline to Get Ready for the Semester
Update CTA to Shop Back-to-School Gear
Click Save, and your changes reflect everywhere—instantly.

‍

🧭 Summary
Using Theme Settings to share content between your homepage and CreatorCommerce landing pages is a low-code way to unify your customer journey, reduce maintenance, and stay nimble with marketing campaigns.

‍

Once this pattern is in place, your team can:

Run faster experiments
Reduce manual editing
Maintain brand integrity across personalized funnels
