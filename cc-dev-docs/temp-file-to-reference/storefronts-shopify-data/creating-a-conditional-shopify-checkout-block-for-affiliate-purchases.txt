How to create a conditional Shopify 🟨 Checkout Block for affiliate purchases
This guide will walk you through the process of creating a customized checkout block that appears only when customers are purchasing through an affiliate link.

Overview
A conditional checkout block allows you to display specific messaging or content to customers who have entered your store through an affiliate link. This can be useful for:

Emphasizing exclusive discounts
Acknowledging the affiliate relationship
Providing specific instructions or information
Building trust and transparency
‍

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Create a New Block
Navigate to your Shopify checkout settings
Select "Add new block"
Choose a block type (e.g., Banner, FAQ, or another template that suits your needs)
Give your block a descriptive name (e.g., "Creator Support Banner")
‍

2. Add Your Content
Click "Edit" on your new block
Add your desired messaging. Some effective approaches include:
Discount confirmation (e.g., "You're receiving an exclusive 40% discount")
Affiliate acknowledgment (e.g., "Complete your checkout to support [Creator Name]")
Value proposition (e.g., "You're shopping through a creator's affiliate link")
‍

3. Set Display Rules
This is the crucial step that makes your block appear only for affiliate purchases:

Click on "Display Rules"
Select "Cart attribute" as the condition
Choose "contains" as the operator
Enter "cc-creator-id" as the attribute
Leave the value field open to check for any value
‍

Note: The CC Creator ID attribute is automatically added when a shopper enters through an affiliate link.

‍

4. Additional Configuration (Optional)
For discount-specific messaging, you can add an additional display rule:

Add a condition for "Discount code is not blank"
This ensures discount-related messages only appear after the discount is applied
‍

5. Implementation in the Checkout Editor
Save your block and note the assigned block ID
Open your checkout editor
Navigate to the section where you want the block to appear
Add a dynamic content placeholder
Link it to your block using the assigned block ID
‍

Best Practices
Keep messaging clear and concise
Test the display rules thoroughly
Consider creating different blocks for different scenarios (e.g., one for discounts, another for general affiliate acknowledgment)
Ensure your messaging aligns with your brand voice and affiliate agreements
‍

Advanced Options
You can enhance your blocks by:

Personalizing content using cart data
Incorporating meta object data about the creator
Using different block types for various purposes
Adding visual elements that match your brand
‍

Troubleshooting
If your block isn't displaying:

Verify the CC Creator ID attribute is being properly set
Check your display rules configuration
Ensure the block ID is correctly linked in the checkout editor
Test the checkout flow through an actual affiliate link
