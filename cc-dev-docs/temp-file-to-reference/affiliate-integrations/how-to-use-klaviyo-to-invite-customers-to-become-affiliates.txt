How to use Klaviyo to invite customers to become affiliates
A guide for nudging qualified customers to apply and join your gated affiliate/influencer community. This guide is not relevant if you automatically convert customers into affiliates already.


This strategy is only applicable if you affiliate management software isn't already converting customers into affiliates. Said differently, this guide is for merchants who are only recruiting influencers/affiliates through opt-in or sign-up forms -- in which case, this article will walk through how to setup a Klaviyo flow that targets qualified customers who should be nudged to join your program. This article will also touch on ways to craft your email and will include a couple templates.

‍

Step 1: Create a flow for 'Post-Purchase Followup - Convert Customers to Affiliates'
Setup the flow
Go to Flows
Click "Create flow"
Click "Create From Scratch"
Name your flow "Post-Purchase Followup - Convert Customers to Affiliates" and apply the tag "CreatorCommerce"
For your trigger, select "Metric", and then select "Ordered Product"
Add a Profile filter for "Has not been in flow at any time"
Add a Profile filter to require them to reach an order count by selecting "What someone has done (or not done)" the selecting "Placed Order" and then setting that to your required order count threshold, such as "2".
Additionally add a Profile filter to ensure they have not already apart of your affiliate program. You can do this by selecting "Properties about someone" and the selecting "Affiliate Code" (Or any other field relevant to your affiliate integration) and setting to "is not set"
