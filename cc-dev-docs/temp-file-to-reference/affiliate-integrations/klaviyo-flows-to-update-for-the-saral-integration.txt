Klaviyo flows to create for the SARAL integration
This guide walks you through flows to setup to invite SARAL-sourced influencers to collaborate & co-sell with your brand, and provides a consistent stream of follow-ups to ensure action.

⚠️ This guide can take up to 30min to complete - it's highly recommend to allow the CreatorCommerce team to do this for you. Submit this form to enable the CreatorCommerce team to complete email setup for you.
However, if you'd like to learn and do this yourself, you can complete the remainder of this guide to accomplish a lightweight implementation.
‍

Step 1: Create a segment for CreatorCommerce Invitees
When the flow that follows is built & enabled, it will use the following segment to target individuals who should be given CreatorCommerce access. For this reason, when creating the segment, you'll initially want to leave the definition blank, as to avoid adding anyone to it before it has been tested end-to-end with the entire flow. This will already be done if you setup your primary Klaviyo invitation flow. To create the segment that will power the invitation flow, follow these steps in Klaviyo:

Go to Lists & Segments
Click Create "List/Segment"
Select "Segment"
Title your Segment "CreatorCommerce Invitees"
Apply the tag "CreatorCommerce"
For the definition, select "Properties about someone", and then select "Email". Enter the email address of "test@email.com".
Click "Create Segment"
Expected result: A segment will be created with no profiles included. This is good news because it allows us to build a flow around this segment, that we can add people to later to test with.

‍

Step 2: Create an email template for your emails
Make your life easier by creating an email template (which should essentially be a simpler version of your existing templates). This will already be done if you setup your primary Klaviyo invitation flow.

Create the template
Go to Templates
Click "Create a Blank Template" or click to "Clone Template"
Name your template "CreatorCommerce Template"
Template sections
Brand Logo/Header - Set to your brand logo
H1 Title - Set to "Lorem ipsum"
Body Copy Section 1 - Set to "Lorem Ipsum"
CTA/Button - Set copy to "Accept Invitation", and set link "https://dashboard.creatorcommerce.shop/invitation?email={{ email }}&channel=<<INSERT-MYSHOPIFY-DOMAIN-HERE>>"
Body Copy Section 2 - Set to "Lorem ipsum"
(Optional) Promotional/teaser image that shows off what a shop looks like - Contact us to get one for your brand
‍

Pro tip: Don't forget to replace <<INSERT-MYSHOPIFY-DOMAIN-HERE>> with your actual myshopify domain such as: https://dashboard.creatorcommerce.shop/invitation?email={{ email }}&channel=house-ofleon.myshopify.com

Step 3: Repeatable steps for each Klaviyo Flow
As you build out the flows, there's a handful of steps that will take place for each any every flow. Repeat these steps each & every time.

Base each flow to the "CreatorCommerce Invitees" Segment
When creating each flow, you'll select the "CreatorCommerce Invitees" segment as the trigger condition.

Add a delay step at the beginning
Before adding any steps to the flow, add a 30 minute delay to each flow.

Update profiles that get invited to CreatorCommerce
To support with any future tracking or reconciliation, it's recommended to update profile properties when a user has officially heard about the opportunity with CreatorCommerce.

For the second step in the flow, after the delay (or as the first step if the flow does not have a delay), add the "Profile property update" block
For the configuration, select "Create new property" with a "Property Label" of "invited-to-creatorcommerce", a type of "Boolean", and a "Property Value" of "True". When complete select "Save".
‍

Step 4: Create the flows
It's time to assemble the flows.

Setup the foundation for each flow
Go to Flows
Click "Create flow"
Click "Create From Scratch"
Name your flow accordingly and apply the tag "CreatorCommerce"
Set the starter trigger to be based on inclusion in "CreatorCommerce Invitees"
Add the relevant delays & profile property updates
The examples below provide a generic approach for updating your SARAL flows for CreatorCommerce. It's recommended to emphasize positioning & tone that better reflect the merits of your current affiliate programs.
