To get affiliates/influencers/partners to launch co-branded shops with your brand, they first need to become aware of the opportunity. While there are other strategies you can leverage for issuing invitations, your primary Klaviyo flow will drive most of your adoption, and is extremely important to enable before updating your relevant programs/tiers for CreatorCommerce. The article will walk you through setting up this flow in Klaviyo. If you don't want to read it and would rather get some hands on support, you can make a request for the CreatorCommerce team to do this for you here.

Step 2: Understanding the email flows
CreatorCommerce will provide your with 8 email flows. This will take you through what each flow is for, why affiliates enter each one, and how they leave each one. Make sure to review each for yourself in your Klaviyo, and make edits where needed. These flows will be "production-ready", and can go live after your review.
