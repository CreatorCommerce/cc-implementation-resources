How to enroll a Social Snowball program into a CreatorCommerce campaign
This quick guide covers the path of making a new program in Social Snowball, and how to connect it with an existing or new CreatorCommerce program.

Start in Social Snowball
Start by going to Programs, the click to create a new program.

Once in the program builder name sure to do the following:

Include "CC //" in the title of the program to make it visible to CreatorCommerce
Include the commission/discount details your prefer
For the "Landing Page" > click "Custom URL" > enter: apps/cc-storefront/redirect
Finish up with the details you prefer, and then save
‍

Add an affiliate to the new program for CreatorCommerce to pick-up on the new program. If doing this for a program that already exists with affiliates, then you shouldn't need to do anything else after renaming the program.

‍

Head to CreatorCommerce
Go to the "Tiers" tab, and examine your new program.

Head to the "Campaigns" tab, and choose to make a new campaign, or select an existing campaign:

From the tier dropdown, select the relevant Social Snowball program
Fill out the rest of your campaign details
Press save
‍

By enrolling individuals from the new program in a CreatorCommerce campaign, you will not see them appear int he "Creators" tab. If they have never been activated in a campaign, you will not see them in the CreatorCommerce dashboard. From here they will experience your new program based on the settings of the campaign they were enrolled in.
