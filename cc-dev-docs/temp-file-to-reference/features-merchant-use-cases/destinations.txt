What Are Destinations in Creator Commerce?

Destinations control where shoppers land after clicking a creator or affiliate link.
They connect specific creator tiers from your affiliate platform to co-branded shopping experiences on your storefront.

Think of a destination as the rule that says:

“When someone clicks a link from this group of creators, send the shopper to this type of page.”

How Destinations Work

A destination is made up of three core parts:
	1.	Collaboration tiers
These come from your affiliate platform (like GRIN, Social Snowball, Refersion, etc.).
They might be called:
	•	Tiers
	•	Programs
	•	Groups
	•	Segments
	2.	Landing page logic
This determines the URL or type of co-branded experience the shopper sees.
	3.	Optional query parameters
These add tracking or personalization data to the final URL.

When a shopper clicks a creator’s link:
	1.	Creator Commerce detects the click.
	2.	It identifies the creator and their tier.
	3.	It checks which destination that tier is assigned to.
	4.	The shopper is sent to the correct co-branded page.

If no destination applies, the shopper is safely sent to the homepage.

What You Configure in a Destination

Here’s what you’ll typically set up inside a destination.

1) Destination Name

This is just for internal reference.

Example:
	•	Paid CORE
	•	Ambassador Program
	•	VIP Creators

It helps your team understand what group the destination applies to.

2) Collaboration Tiers

You select which affiliate tiers should use this destination.

From the screenshot, examples include:
	•	CC // Paid Affiliates
	•	CC // Q1 Paid (Jan–Mar) 2026
	•	Affiliates
	•	Paid gifting

Important rules:
	•	A tier can only belong to one destination at a time.
	•	If you assign a tier to a new destination, it will be removed from the previous one.

3) Landing Page URL Template

This determines where shoppers land.

Example from the screenshot:

https://cozyearth.com/pages/creator/{{shop.handle}}

This creates a unique page per creator.

So if a creator’s handle is:

jane-doe

The shopper lands on:

https://cozyearth.com/pages/creator/jane-doe

This is how Creator Commerce generates personalized, co-branded experiences at scale.

If this field is left blank:
	•	Creator Commerce still applies discounts and tracking.
	•	But shoppers will land on your default storefront pages.

⸻

4) Query Parameters (Optional)

These add tracking or personalization data to the final URL.

Example from the screenshot:

cc={{shop.handle}}&utm_source=grin

This could produce a final URL like:

https://cozyearth.com/pages/creator/jane-doe?cc=jane-doe&utm_source=grin

This helps:
	•	Track traffic sources
	•	Trigger personalization
	•	Power analytics and attribution

Example Flow

Here’s a simple end-to-end example.

Setup:
	•	Destination: Paid CORE
	•	Tier: CC // Paid Affiliates
	•	Landing template:
/pages/creator/{{shop.handle}}

What happens:
	1.	A shopper clicks an affiliate link from creator jane-doe.
	2.	Creator Commerce identifies that:
	•	Jane is in CC // Paid Affiliates.
	•	That tier is mapped to Paid CORE.
	3.	The shopper is redirected to:

/pages/creator/jane-doe


	4.	Discounts, UTMs, and tracking are preserved.

Why Destinations Matter

Destinations let you:
	•	Send different creator groups to different experiences
	•	Run seasonal or campaign-based pages
	•	Test different funnels by tier
	•	Control landing behavior without changing links

They are the core system that connects:
affiliate tiers → co-branded storefront experiences.

Quick Setup Checklist

To use destinations:
	1.	Connect your affiliate integration.
	2.	Go to Destinations in Creator Commerce.
	3.	Create a new destination.
	4.	Select the tiers that should use it.
	5.	Set a landing page template (optional).
	6.	Save.

Once active, any creator in those tiers will automatically route shoppers to the correct co-branded experience.

If you’d like, I can also produce:
	•	A shorter in-app tooltip version
	•	A visual diagram of the destination flow
	•	A “common setups” guide (paid, gifting, ambassador, etc.)





    P.s. add in that adding view=[NAME] is how to set any destination to auto flip the page template on the landing page, product page, etc after the click
