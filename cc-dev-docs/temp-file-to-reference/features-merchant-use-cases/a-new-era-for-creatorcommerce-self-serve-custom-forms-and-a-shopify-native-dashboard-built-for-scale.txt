A new era for CreatorCommerce: Self-serve, custom forms, and a Shopify-native dashboard built for scale

Today is one of those milestone days — the kind you grind toward for months, quietly fighting through complexity while still shipping for customers in the foreground. Because today, CreatorCommerce officially becomes self-serve. And it arrives alongside one of the most powerful new capabilities we’ve ever released: custom forms built directly into our new Shopify Polaris dashboard.


It feels simple now.

But getting here definitely wasn’t.

‍

The truth: PMF is soaring… but a nasty ops problem has been brewing
This year was huge for validating our product-market fit. But under the surface, we were drifting into dangerous territory. Merchants are not just asking for co-branded landing pages — they are rethinking their entire growth models, their theme strategies, and the way they activate creators.

‍

This means pressure.

Real pressure.

‍

Custom code inside merchant themes
Overnight feature builds
Ad hoc integrations
Internal dev tools duct-taped together
And at times… essentially becoming the eComm manager for their influencer collabs & stepping up to run everything
Brands on the right plans have been getting exactly what they needed.

‍

But the rest? They were unintentionally left behind.

And the platform itself?

It has become too technical (without a non-technical outlet to off set to).

‍

Features haven't been making it into the dashboard fast enough.

‍

Support pressure is stacking up.

So we made the kind of call founders usually lose sleep over:

‍

Pause net-new features. Pause major sales pushes. And rebuild the foundation the right way.

‍

The result: A fully embedded, Shopify-native dashboard that merchants actually understand is here
As of this week, every CC merchant can update their CreatorCommerce app and unlock a brand-new dashboard — one that feels native to Shopify, fast to navigate, and radically easier to understand.

‍


Instead of reinventing UI patterns, we embraced the familiar: Shopify Polaris, the design language merchants already use every day.

‍

And the moment we made that decision, everything clicked.

‍

This new dashboard lets you:

Build co-branded UX directly on your theme — without touching a line of code
Use CC inside a UI that feels like Shopify, not another app you have to learn
Access every feature, switch, and toggle from one spot
Click into help articles, dev docs, flows, and integrations without hunting
Understand features before enabling them — no more guesswork
Implement in minutes, not hours or days
‍

This is a humble UX reset with a very loud impact: merchants learn faster, we ship faster, and everyone gets to outcomes faster.

‍

And now the game-changer: Custom forms you can build On the fly
Inside this new dashboard lives one of the most powerful tools we’ve ever shipped:

‍

CreatorCommerce Forms — rebuilt to be simple, flexible, and completely self-serve.

‍

Forms are the lifeblood of meaningful collaboration. Recruitment forms are fine for approvals — but what about everything after approval? How do you run a collaboration full of content, storytelling, and conversion-driven merch?

‍

You do it by collecting the right data at the right time.

‍

CreatorCommerce now supports four form types that map to the full creator lifecycle:

‍

Onboarding Forms
Your activation moment — “You’re approved! Let’s build your storefront.”

‍

Collection Forms
Perfect for ongoing curation with high-SKU brands.

‍

Product Forms
Ideal for CPG or vertical brands where creators need to go deep on a few select products.

‍

Custom Forms
For everything else: B2B affiliates, brand questionnaires, creative briefs, business info — whatever your program requires.

‍

Building one is dead-simple:

Title + description
Choose which collab tiers should receive it
Pick fields from your Custom Field Builder
Add labels or instructions
Save + toggle on
The system emails creators automatically
‍

Creators see these forms directly inside their storefront editor, complete with guided steps to upload logos, banners, copy, product details — and all of it immediately flows into their co-branded experience.

‍

This isn’t “collecting data.”

‍

This is creators actively shaping their own storefronts, fueling better merch, fresher funnels, and higher conversion.

‍

Self-Serve isn’t a feature — It’s a turning point
We didn’t build this dashboard to look pretty.

‍

We built it because brands were breaking the old model. They need:

Faster activation
Faster personalization
Faster iteration
Less engineering
Less hand-holding
More control
And now they have it.

‍

Whether you’re a category-leading brand or a solopreneur, you can now stand up co-branded creator experiences without needing to code and without needing to relearn a new UI paradigm.

‍

If you can manage Shopify collections or metafields, you can manage CreatorCommerce.

‍

A new chapter for Q4 and beyond
We’re proud of what ships today — not because it’s flashy, but because it’s foundational.

‍

It sets the stage for everything coming next: deeper automation, smarter defaults, richer data, and more ways for creators to meaningfully shape the commerce experiences they promote.

‍

Self-serve is here.

‍

Custom forms are here.

‍

And the new Shopify-native CreatorCommerce dashboard is officially live.

‍

Let’s build this next chapter together.
