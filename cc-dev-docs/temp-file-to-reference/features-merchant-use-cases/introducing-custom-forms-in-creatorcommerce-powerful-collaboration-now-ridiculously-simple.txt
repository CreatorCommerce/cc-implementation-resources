Introducing Custom Forms in CreatorCommerce: Powerful collaboration, now ridiculously simple

There’s a moment every brand hits with influencer marketing: you approve a creator… and then what? A recruitment form got you the top-of-funnel context — a name, a handle, maybe a paragraph about why they want to work with you — but it does absolutely nothing to help you run a real collaboration. No content brief. No product curation. No story. No funnel. Nothing.


This gap has always been the bottleneck.

‍

And that’s exactly what we’ve eliminated.

‍

With the new CreatorCommerce Embedded Dashboard, building truly customized, collaboration-ready forms takes minutes — no ops person, no spreadsheet circus, no engineering ticket. It’s clean, intuitive, and built for how modern brands actually collaborate.

‍

Why forms matter more than anyone realizes
Recruitment is just the start. The magic happens after approval — when creators shape the content, products, and onsite experience that ultimately drive conversions. That requires data. Structured data. Creative data. Merchandising data. Funnel-shaping data.

‍

So we built the simplest, fastest way to collect it.

‍

CreatorCommerce now supports four purpose-built form types, each tailored to a phase of the collaboration lifecycle:

‍


‍

1. Onboarding Forms
The instant welcome moment. Automatically fire off an activation form when someone’s approved. Gather what they need for their first personalized storefront — quickly, clearly, and with zero manual follow-up.

‍

2. Collection Forms
Perfect for high-SKU or high-curation brands. Let creators build collections over time, request new product mixes, or update their storefront narrative on the fly.

‍

3. Product Forms
Ideal for CPG and vertical brands with fewer SKUs but deeper storytelling needs. Capture product-level content, flavor notes, UGC ideas, comparisons, and more.

‍

4. Custom Forms
The wildcard. B2B affiliate intake, recipe submissions, photoshoot preferences, brand-bio questions, wholesale details — whatever data your program needs, you can collect it.

‍


‍

Build a form in seconds — No tech, no tickets
The new builder removes every friction point. You simply:

Give the form a title and description
Choose which tiers or segments should receive it
(In the demo: Shop by Collabs tiers — but this matches your real setup exactly.)
Pick the fields you want
Every option comes from your Custom Field Builder — the same flexible system that lets you create any data type you need, from logos and banners to copy blocks and business details.
Add labels and descriptions for creators
Save it, toggle it on, and you’re done
‍

The system automatically emails eligible creators, drops the form into their CreatorCommerce editor, and routes their submissions back into your personalization engine.

‍

What Creators See: A guided, zero-friction workflow
When a creator logs into their store editor, the forms you’ve assigned appear instantly — no digging, no guessing, no mystery. They get a clean, step-by-step experience:

Upload their logo
Add a banner
Write their hero header
Submit collection details
Provide product-specific content
Share brand or business info
‍

And behind the scenes, that data flows straight into their personalized storefront, shaping a shopping experience that’s differentiated, conversion-oriented, and actually worth sharing.

‍

Creators love it because it feels empowering.

‍

Brands love it because it eliminates chaos.

‍

A better way to run creator programs
This isn’t a plugin slapped onto the side of your workflow. It’s a foundational tool for:

Scaling creator onboarding without manual ops
Increasing conversion through deeper personalization
Giving creators a real role in merchandising
Building differentiated collab experiences at speed
Keeping your entire program structured and repeatable
In short: if you’re serious about running meaningful collaborations — not just recruiting creators — this is the simplest, smartest way to capture the data that fuels them.
