Setting Your Affiliate Integration Live in Creator Commerce

Connecting your affiliate platform is the first step to launching co-branded shopping experiences. This guide walks you through the core steps so your creators’ links start routing into Creator Commerce pages.

⸻

Step 1: Choose Your Affiliate Platform

Before anything else, decide which affiliate or creator platform you’ll be connecting. Common options include:
	•	Social Snowball
	•	Refersion
	•	GoAffPro
	•	GRIN
	•	UpPromote
	•	Shopify Collabs
	•	Other supported providers

This platform acts as your core payout and tracking system. It remains the source of truth for commissions and reporting, while Creator Commerce builds the shopping experiences behind the links.

⸻

Step 2: Connect the Integration

From your Creator Commerce dashboard:
	1.	Go to Integrations.
	2.	Select your affiliate provider.
	3.	Follow the required setup steps.

Depending on the platform, this may involve:
	•	Adding an API key
	•	Enabling webhooks
	•	Turning on the Creator Commerce integration inside the affiliate tool

Once connected, Creator Commerce will begin syncing your creators and affiliate data.
At this stage, nothing changes on your storefront yet—data is simply being imported.

⸻

Step 3: Enable a Destination for a Tier

Next, decide which group of affiliates should receive co-branded pages.

In Creator Commerce:
	1.	Go to the Destinations tool.
	2.	Create or enable a destination.
	3.	Map it to a specific tier from your affiliate platform.

Different platforms use different terminology:
	•	Tiers
	•	Programs
	•	Groups
	•	Segments

They all represent the same concept: a subset of your affiliates.

Once a destination is enabled, Creator Commerce will generate co-branded pages for any creators enrolled in that tier.

⸻

Step 4: Point Affiliate Links to the Redirect

This is the final step that activates the experience.

Inside your affiliate platform, update the destination of your affiliate links to:

/apps/cc-storefront/redirect

You can do this:
	•	One creator at a time, or
	•	Across an entire tier, or
	•	Across your full affiliate program

This redirect acts as a safe landing zone. When someone clicks an affiliate link:
	1.	Creator Commerce detects the click in real time.
	2.	It checks whether that creator is enrolled in a destination.
	3.	The shopper is sent to:
	•	A co-branded landing page, or
	•	Your homepage if no destination applies.

Because of this fallback logic, it’s safe to apply the redirect broadly.

⸻

What Happens After Setup

Once everything is live:
	•	Existing affiliate links keep working.
	•	UTMs are preserved from the original link to the final page.
	•	Discount codes continue to apply as usual.
	•	Tracking and payouts remain in your affiliate platform.

Creator Commerce simply powers the co-branded storefront experience behind the click.

⸻

Summary Checklist

To go live:
	1.	Choose your affiliate platform.
	2.	Connect it in Integrations.
	3.	Enable a Destination for a tier.
	4.	Update affiliate links to
/apps/cc-storefront/redirect.

After that, your integration is fully live.






EXTRA CONTTEXT




Creator Commerce lets you connect directly to the affiliate, ambassador, and creator platforms you already use—so every partner can automatically become a personalized storefront, drop, or funnel.

‍

This guide walks you through how to connect your first Enrollment & Recruitment Integration, what to expect, and how to activate your collaborations.

‍

What is an Enrollment & Recruitment Integration?
Enrollment & recruitment tools are platforms that help you:

Recruit creators, affiliates, ambassadors, or B2B partners
Track their referrals, codes, links, and tiers
Manage payouts and performance
‍

When you connect one of these tools to Creator Commerce, we sync your partners in real time as Collaborations—which you can then turn into:

Co-branded landing pages
Shoppable creator storefronts
Drops, bundles, and campaigns
Personalized discounts & content
‍

Supported Providers
Creator Commerce currently supports (and continues to expand):

Social Snowball
Shopify Collabs
Refersion
GRIN
GoAffPro
UpPromote
Each provider has a slightly different connection method. The flow is always the same:

Creator Commerce → Integrations → Choose Provider → Complete Provider Setup → Sync Collaborations
‍

Step 1 — Open the Integrations Page
Log into your Creator Commerce Dashboard
In the left sidebar, click Integrations
Select Enrollment & Recruitment
Choose your provider (e.g., Social Snowball, GoAffPro, GRIN)
You’ll now see setup instructions that are specific to that platform.

‍

Step 2 — Complete the Provider Setup
Each provider requires a different activation method. Below are the most common patterns.

‍

🔹 Social Snowball
How it connects:

You enable Creator Commerce from inside Social Snowball.

Steps:

Log into Social Snowball
Go to Settings → Integrations
Find Creator Commerce and enable it
Approve the connection
Once enabled, your creators will begin syncing automatically into Creator Commerce.

‍

🔹 Shopify Collabs
How it connects:

This integration runs through Shopify Flow.

Steps:

Open Shopify Admin
Install Shopify Flow (if not already installed)
Import the Creator Commerce Flow template
Activate the workflow
This allows Collabs partners to sync into Creator Commerce whenever they are approved, updated, or enrolled.

‍

🔹 GoAffPro
How it connects:

Using your API Key.

Steps:

Open your GoAffPro dashboard
Copy your API Key
Return to Creator Commerce → Integrations → GoAffPro
Paste the API key and click Connect
‍

🔹 Refersion, GRIN, UpPromote
These follow one of two models:

API key authentication
OAuth-style authorization
Each integration page in Creator Commerce will show the exact steps required for that platform.

⚠️ Important: Always follow the provider-specific instructions shown in Creator Commerce, even if you’ve connected other tools before.
‍

Step 3 — Confirm the Sync
Once your integration is connected:

Creator Commerce will pull in your creators, affiliates, or ambassadors
They will appear as Collaborations inside your dashboard
You’ll now see:

Names
Referral links or codes
Platform metadata
Status and tiers (if supported by the provider)
This happens automatically—no CSV uploads or manual mapping.

‍

Step 4 — Activate Your Collaborations
Now the real magic starts.

From the Collaborations table, you can:

Enroll partners into Destinations
Assign them to Drops, Collections, or Bundles
Generate co-branded landing pages
Apply creator-specific discounts, copy, and products
Each collaboration becomes its own shoppable funnel.

‍

Why This Matters
Most affiliate platforms stop at the link.

Creator Commerce goes further—turning every enrolled partner into a fully merchandised storefront powered by:

Your products
Their content
Your brand logic
You’re no longer tracking referrals.

You’re building creator-powered commerce channels.

If you need help setting up a specific provider, visit the integration’s detail page inside Creator Commerce or contact support.
