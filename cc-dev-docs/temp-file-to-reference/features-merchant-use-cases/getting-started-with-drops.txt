What are Drops?
Drops are the building block of creator-powered merchandising in our system. Think of them as curated product lists with extra context—titles, descriptions, images or videos, creator notes, even pricing cues or discounts.

‍

A Drop is flexible: it can look like a collection, a bundle, or a basket. The point is: if you want multiple products grouped together under a creator’s voice, Drops are the tool.

‍

Why Drops Matter
Most marketers think about creator traffic as “get them to buy one hero product.” That works—but it leaves money on the table.

‍

Drops let you:

Tell a story: “Here’s my full skincare routine” vs. “Buy this cleanser.”
Increase order size: shoppers see the bigger picture and are nudged to add more.
Make it easy: with one click, a shopper can add the whole Drop to their cart.
Stay flexible: Drops can be collections, bundles, or curated kits. To each their own.

Where You’ll Use Drops
On creator pages → Display curated Drops front and center.
In featured carousels → Rotate Drops like seasonal collections.
In your theme’s product lists → Swap your standard collection feed for Drops.
With prebuilt Drop sections → Show the Drop with bundle total + discount built in.
In creator dashboards → Let creators make and share their own Drops.
‍

How Creators Use Drops
Creators can:

Curate products that fit their style or story.
Add context with titles, images, or short notes (“Why I picked this”).
Publish instantly on their co-branded page.
Share checkout links directly to their Drops in Stories, bios, or DMs.
No spreadsheets. No technical setup. Just curation and sharing.

‍

Drops + Forms
Drops can be collected through:

Onboarding forms → capture a creator’s go-to picks right away.
Custom campaign forms → e.g. “Holiday Gifting Set.”
Creator dashboards → ongoing curation, updates, and bundle sharing.
This means Drops are always up to date and tailored to each campaign.

‍

Best Practices for Drops
Positioning matters → Put Drops above the fold on creator pages.
Show the value → Display the total price with discount included (if applicable).
Make it simple → One-click “Add All,” plus the option to buy individual items.
Leverage trust → Creator notes are powerful; they beat generic product copy.
Think mobile → Make sure “Add All” is easy to tap on phones.
‍

Measuring Success
When you roll out Drops, look at:

Average order value (AOV) vs. traffic without Drops
Adoption rate → how often shoppers hit “Add All”
Attach rate → how many orders include multiple Drop items
Link performance → creator page vs. direct checkout link
‍

If a Drop isn’t driving engagement or revenue, update it. Treat Drops like a living retail display.

‍

FAQs
Are Drops just Shopify Collections?
Not quite. A Collection is a broad group of products. A Drop is curated—it comes with context, creator voice, and often a clear call to “Add All.”

‍

Do Drops always need a discount?
No. The creator’s curation alone adds value. Discounts help, but Drops work without them.

‍

What if something is out of stock?
The Drop still works—shoppers can add what’s available, and you can update the Drop anytime.

‍

The Bottom Line
Drops are the foundation for creator-driven shopping experiences. They turn a creator’s taste into shoppable storytelling, whether as a bundle, a collection, or a seasonal kit.
