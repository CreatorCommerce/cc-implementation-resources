#### February 21, 2026

* **Docs MCP Launch**: We launched the CreatorCommerce documentation MCP endpoint and setup guide for AI-assisted development. Start with [Connect to CreatorCommerce MCP](/guides/mcp).

* **AI Setup Docs Refresh**: Cursor and Claude setup pages now point to the MCP-first flow so setup is consistent across coding assistants. See [Coding in Cursor](/guides/cursor-coding) and [Coding in Claude Code](/guides/claude-coding).

* **New Codex Setup Resource**: Added a dedicated Codex setup page that uses the same MCP-first pattern. See [Coding in Codex](/guides/codex-coding).

* **MCP Prompting Resources**: Added/updated practical MCP usage references for implementation workflows. See [MCP Examples](/guides/mcp-examples).
